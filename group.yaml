title: Guide to the Secure Configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
description: |
  This guide presents a catalog of security-relevant configuration
  settings for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. It is a rendering of content
  structured in the eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
  (XCCDF) in order to support security automation. The SCAP content is is
  available in the `scap-security-guide` package which is developed at
  http://fedorahosted.org/scap-security-guide.

  Providing system administrators with such guidance informs them how to
  securely configure systems under their control in a variety of network
  roles. Policy makers and baseline creators can use this catalog of
  settings, with its associated references to higher-level security
  control catalogs, in order to assist them in security baseline creation.
  This guide is a *catalog, not a checklist,* and satisfaction of every
  item is not likely to be possible or sensible in any operational
  scenario. However, the XCCDF format enables granular selection and
  adjustment of settings, and their association with OVAL and OCIL content
  provides an automated checking capability. Transformations of this
  document, and its associated automated checking content, are capable of
  providing baselines that meet a diverse set of policy objectives. Some
  example XCCDF *Profiles*, which are selections of items that form
  checklists and can be used as baselines, are available with this guide.
  They can be processed, in an automated fashion, with tools that support
  the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). The DISA STIG for RHEL
  6, which provides required settings for US Department of Defense
  systems, is one example of a baseline created from this guidance.
