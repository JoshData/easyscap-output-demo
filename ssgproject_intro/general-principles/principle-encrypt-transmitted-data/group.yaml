title: Encrypt Transmitted Data Whenever Possible
description: |
  Data transmitted over a network, whether wired or wireless, is
  susceptible to passive monitoring. Whenever practical solutions for
  encrypting such data exist, they should be applied. Even if data is
  expected to be transmitted only over a local network, it should still be
  encrypted. Encrypting authentication data, such as passwords, is
  particularly important. Networks of RHEL 6 machines can and should be
  configured so that no unencrypted authentication data is ever
  transmitted between machines.
