title: Configure Security Tools to Improve System Robustness
description: |
  Several tools exist which can be effectively used to improve a system’s
  resistance to and detection of unknown attacks. These tools can improve
  robustness against attack at the cost of relatively little configuration
  effort. In particular, this guide recommends and discusses the use of
  Iptables for host-based firewalling, SELinux for protection against
  vulnerable services, and a logging and auditing infrastructure for
  detection of problems.
