title: Root Shell Environment Assumed
description: |
  Most of the actions listed in this document are written with the
  assumption that they will be executed by the root user running the
  `/bin/bash` shell. Commands preceded with a hash mark (\#) assume that
  the administrator will execute the commands as root, i.e. apply the
  command via `sudo` whenever possible, or use `su` to gain root
  privileges if `sudo` cannot be used. Commands which can be executed as a
  non-root user are are preceded by a dollar sign (\$) prompt.
