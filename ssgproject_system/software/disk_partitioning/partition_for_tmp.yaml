title: Ensure /tmp Located On Separate Partition
description: |
  The `/tmp` directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary
  file storage. Ensure it has its own partition or logical volume at
  installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
rationale: |
  The `/tmp` partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.
  Placing `/tmp` in its own partition enables the setting of more
  restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.
