  `/`, `/boot`, and `swap`.

  -   If starting with any of the default layouts, check the box to
      “Review and modify partitioning.” This allows for the easy creation
      of additional logical volumes inside the volume group already
      created, though it may require making `/`’s logical volume smaller
      to create space. In general, using logical volumes is preferable to
      using partitions because they can be more easily adjusted later.
  -   If creating a custom layout, create the partitions mentioned in the
      previous paragraph (which the installer will require anyway), as
      well as separate ones described in the following sections.

  If a system has already been installed, and the default partitioning
  scheme was used, it is possible but nontrivial to modify it to create
  separate logical volumes for the directories listed above. The Logical
  Volume Manager (LVM) makes this possible. See the LVM HOWTO at
  http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/ for more detailed information on LVM.
