title: Ensure /var/log Located On Separate Partition
description: |
  System logs are stored in the `/var/log` directory. Ensure that it has
  its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it
  using LVM.
rationale: |
  Placing `/var/log` in its own partition enables better separation
  between log files and other files in `/var/`.
