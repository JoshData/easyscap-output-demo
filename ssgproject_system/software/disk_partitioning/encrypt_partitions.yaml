title: Encrypt Partitions
description: |
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 natively supports partition encryption
  through the Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology.
  The easiest way to encrypt a partition is during installation time.

  For manual installations, select the `Encrypt` checkbox during partition
  creation to encrypt the partition. When this option is selected the
  system will prompt for a passphrase to use in decrypting the partition.
  The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually every time
  the system boots.

  <p>
  For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart
  by adding the `--encrypted` and `--passphrase=` options to the
  definition of each partition to be encrypted. For example, the following
  line would encrypt the root partition:

      part / --fstype=ext3 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE

  Any *PASSPHRASE* is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the
  Kickstart must then be protected accordingly. Omitting the
  `--passphrase=` option from the partition definition will cause the
  installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during
  installation.

  Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS can be found on
  the Red Hat Documentation web site:\

rationale: |
  The risk of a systemâ€™s physical compromise, particularly mobile systems
  such as laptops, places its data at risk of compromise. Encrypting this
  data mitigates the risk of its loss if the system is lost.
