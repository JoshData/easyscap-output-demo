title: Ensure /home Located On Separate Partition
description: |
  If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate
  partition for `/home` at installation time (or migrate it later using
  LVM). If `/home` will be mounted from another system such as an NFS
  server, then creating a separate partition is not necessary at
  installation time, and the mountpoint can instead be configured later.
rationale: |
  Ensuring that `/home` is mounted on its own partition enables the
  setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that
  users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data
  storage.
