title: Ensure /var/log/audit Located On Separate Partition
description: |
  Audit logs are stored in the `/var/log/audit` directory. Ensure that it
  has its own partition or logical volume at installation time, or migrate
  it later using LVM. Make absolutely certain that it is large enough to
  store all audit logs that will be created by the auditing daemon.
rationale: |
  Placing `/var/log/audit` in its own partition enables better separation
  between audit files and other files, and helps ensure that auditing
  cannot be halted due to the partition running out of space.
