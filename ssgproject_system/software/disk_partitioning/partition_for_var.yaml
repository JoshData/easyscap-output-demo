title: Ensure /var Located On Separate Partition
description: |
  The `/var` directory is used by daemons and other system services to
  store frequently-changing data. Ensure that `/var` has its own partition
  or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.
rationale: |
  Ensuring that `/var` is mounted on its own partition enables the setting
  of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect system services
  such as daemons or other programs which use it. It is not uncommon for
  the `/var` directory to contain world-writable directories, installed by
  other software packages.
