title: Ensure Software Patches Installed
description: |
  If the system is joined to the Red Hat Network, a Red Hat Satellite
  Server, or a yum server, run the following command to install updates:

      # yum update

  If the system is not configured to use one of these sources, updates (in
  the form of RPM packages) can be manually downloaded from the Red Hat
  Network and installed using `rpm`.
rationale: |
  Installing software updates is a fundamental mitigation against the
  exploitation of publicly-known vulnerabilities.
