title: Updating Software
description: |
  The `yum` command line tool is used to install and update software
  packages. The system also provides a graphical software update tool in
  the **System** menu, in the **Administration** submenu, called
  **Software Update**.

  Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems contain an installed software catalog
  called the RPM database, which records metadata of installed packages.
  Consistently using `yum` or the graphical **Software Update** for all
  software installation allows for insight into the current inventory of
  installed software on the system.
