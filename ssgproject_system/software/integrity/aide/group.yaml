title: Verify Integrity with AIDE
description: |
  AIDE conducts integrity checks by comparing information about files with
  previously-gathered information. Ideally, the AIDE database is created
  immediately after initial system configuration, and then again after any
  software update. AIDE is highly configurable, with further configuration
  information located in `/usr/share/doc/aide-VERSION`.
