title: Verify Integrity with RPM
description: |
  The RPM package management system includes the ability to verify the
  integrity of installed packages by comparing the installed files with
  information about the files taken from the package metadata stored in
  the RPM database. Although an attacker could corrupt the RPM database
  (analogous to attacking the AIDE database as described above), this
  check can still reveal modification of important files. To list which
  files on the system differ from what is expected by the RPM database:

      # rpm -qVa

  See the man page for `rpm` to see a complete explanation of each column.
