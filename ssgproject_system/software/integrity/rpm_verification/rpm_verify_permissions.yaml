title: Verify and Correct File Permissions with RPM
description: |
  The RPM package management system can check file access permissions of
  installed software packages, including many that are important to system
  security. After locating a file with incorrect permissions, run the
  following command to determine which package owns it:

      # rpm -qf FILENAME

  Next, run the following command to reset its permissions to the correct
  values:

      # rpm --setperms PACKAGENAME
rationale: |
  Permissions on system binaries and configuration files that are too
  generous could allow an unauthorized user to gain privileges that they
  should not have. The permissions set by the vendor should be maintained.
  Any deviations from this baseline should be investigated.
