title: Install Virus Scanning Software
description: "Install virus scanning software, which uses signatures to search for
  the\npresence of viruses on the filesystem. The McAfee uvscan virus scanning\ntool
  is provided for DoD systems. Ensure virus definition files are no\nolder than 7
  days, or their last release.\n<!-- need info here on where DoD admins can go to
  get this --> Configure\nthe virus scanning software to perform scans dynamically
  on all accessed\nfiles. If this is not possible, configure the system to scan all
  altered\nfiles on the system on a daily basis. If the system processes inbound\nSMTP
  mail, configure the virus scanner to scan all received mail.\n<!-- what's the basis
  for the IAO language? would not failure of a check\n     imply a discussion, for
  every check in this document, \n     with the IAO (or SSO or ISSO or ISSM or whatever
  is the right acronym in your\n     particular neighborhood) should occur? -->\n"
rationale: |
  Virus scanning software can be used to detect if a system has been
  compromised by computer viruses, as well as to limit their spread to
  other systems.
