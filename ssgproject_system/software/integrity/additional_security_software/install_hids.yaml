title: Install Intrusion Detection Software
description: |
  The base Red Hat platform already includes a sophisticated auditing
  system that can detect intruder activity, as well as SELinux, which
  provides host-based intrusion prevention capabilities by confining
  privileged programs and user sessions which may become compromised. \
rationale: |
  Host-based intrusion detection tools provide a system-level defense when
  an intruder gains access to a system or network.
