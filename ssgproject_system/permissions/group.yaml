title: File Permissions and Masks
description: |
  Traditional Unix security relies heavily on file and directory
  permissions to prevent unauthorized users from reading or modifying
  files to which they should not have access.

  Several of the commands in this section search filesystems for files or
  directories with certain characteristics, and are intended to be run on
  every local partition on a given system. When the variable *PART*
  appears in one of the commands below, it means that the command is
  intended to be run repeatedly, with the name of each local partition
  substituted for *PART* in turn.

  <p>
  The following command prints a list of all ext4 partitions on the local
  system, which is the default filesystem for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
  installations:

      $ mount -t ext4 | awk '{print $3}'

  For any systems that use a different local filesystem type, modify this
  command as appropriate.
