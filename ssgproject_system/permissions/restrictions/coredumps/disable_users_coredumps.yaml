title: Disable Core Dumps for All Users
description: |
  To disable core dumps for all users, add the following line to
  `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

      *     hard   core    0
rationale: |
  A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating
  system terminates an application. The memory image could contain
  sensitive data and is generally useful only for developers trying to
  debug problems.
