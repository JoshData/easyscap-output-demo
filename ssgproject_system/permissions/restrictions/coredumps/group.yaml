title: Disable Core Dumps
description: |
  A core dump file is the memory image of an executable program when it
  was terminated by the operating system due to errant behavior. In most
  cases, only software developers legitimately need to access these files.
  The core dump files may also contain sensitive information, or
  unnecessarily occupy large amounts of disk space.

  Once a hard limit is set in `/etc/security/limits.conf`, a user cannot
  increase that limit within his or her own session. If access to core
  dumps is required, consider restricting them to only certain users or
  groups. See the `limits.conf` man page for more information.

  The core dumps of setuid programs are further protected. The `sysctl`
  variable `fs.suid_dumpable` controls whether the kernel allows core
  dumps from these programs at all. The default value of 0 is recommended.
