title: Enable ExecShield
description: |
  ExecShield describes kernel features that provide protection against
  exploitation of memory corruption errors such as buffer overflows. These
  features include random placement of the stack and other memory regions,
  prevention of execution in memory that should only hold data, and
  special handling of text buffers. These protections are enabled by
  default and controlled through `sysctl` variables `kernel.exec-shield`
  and `kernel.randomize_va_space`.
