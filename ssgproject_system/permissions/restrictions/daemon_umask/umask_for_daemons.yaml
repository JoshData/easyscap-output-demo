title: Set Daemon Umask
description: |
  The file `/etc/init.d/functions` includes initialization parameters for
  most or all daemons started at boot time. The default umask of 022
  prevents creation of group- or world-writable files. To set the default
  umask for daemons, edit the following line, inserting 022 or 027 for
  *UMASK* appropriately:

      umask UMASK

  Setting the umask to too restrictive a setting can cause serious errors
  at runtime. Many daemons on the system already individually restrict
  themselves to a umask of 077 in their own init scripts.
rationale: |
  The umask influences the permissions assigned to files created by a
  process at run time. An unnecessarily permissive umask could result in
  files being created with insecure permissions.
