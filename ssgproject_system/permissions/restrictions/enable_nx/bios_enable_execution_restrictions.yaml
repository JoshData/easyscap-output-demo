title: Enable NX or XD Support in the BIOS
description: |
  Reboot the system and enter the BIOS or Setup configuration menu.
  Navigate the BIOS configuration menu and make sure that the option is
  enabled. The setting may be located under a Security section. Look for
  Execute Disable (XD) on Intel-based systems and No Execute (NX) on
  AMD-based systems.
rationale: |
  Computers with the ability to prevent this type of code execution
  frequently put an option in the BIOS that will allow users to turn the
  feature on or off at will.
