title: Install PAE Kernel on Supported 32-bit x86 Systems
description: |
  Systems that are using the 64-bit x86 kernel package do not need to
  install the kernel-PAE package because the 64-bit x86 kernel already
  includes this support. However, if the system is 32-bit and also
  supports the PAE and NX features as determined in the previous section,
  the kernel-PAE package should be installed to enable XD or NX support:

      # yum install kernel-PAE

  The installation process should also have configured the bootloader to
  load the new kernel at boot. Verify this at reboot and modify
  `/etc/grub.conf` if necessary.
rationale: |
  On 32-bit systems that support the XD or NX bit, the vendor-supplied PAE
  kernel is required to enable either Execute Disable (XD) or No Execute
  (NX) support.
