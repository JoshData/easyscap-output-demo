title: Ensure No World-Writable Files Exist
description: |
  It is generally a good idea to remove global (other) write access to a
  file when it is discovered. However, check with documentation for
  specific applications before making changes. Also, monitor for recurring
  world-writable files, as these may be symptoms of a misconfigured
  application or user account.
rationale: |
  Data in world-writable files can be modified by any user on the system.
  In almost all circumstances, files can be configured using a combination
  of user and group permissions to support whatever legitimate access is
  needed without the risk caused by world-writable files.
