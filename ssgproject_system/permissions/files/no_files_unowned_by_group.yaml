title: Ensure All Files Are Owned by a Group
description: |
  If any files are not owned by a group, then the cause of their lack of
  group-ownership should be investigated. Following this, the files should
  be deleted or assigned to an appropriate group.
rationale: |
  Unowned files do not directly imply a security problem, but they are
  generally a sign that something is amiss. They may be caused by an
  intruder, by incorrect software installation or draft software removal,
  or by failure to remove all files belonging to a deleted account. The
  files should be repaired so they will not cause problems when accounts
  are created in the future, and the cause should be discovered and
  addressed.
