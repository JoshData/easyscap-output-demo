title: Verify that System Executables Have Restrictive Permissions
description: |
  System executables are stored in the following directories by default:

      /bin
      /usr/bin
      /usr/local/bin
      /sbin
      /usr/sbin
      /usr/local/sbin

  All files in these directories should not be group-writable or
  world-writable. If any file *FILE* in these directories is found to be
  group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission with the
  following command:

      # chmod go-w FILE
rationale: |
  System binaries are executed by privileged users, as well as system
  services, and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure execution
  of these programs cannot be co-opted.
