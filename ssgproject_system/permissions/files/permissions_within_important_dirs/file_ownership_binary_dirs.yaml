title: Verify that System Executables Have Root Ownership

  /bin
      /usr/bin
      /usr/local/bin
      /sbin
      /usr/sbin
      /usr/local/sbin

  All files in these directories should be owned by the `root` user. If
  any file *FILE* in these directories is found to be owned by a user
  other than root, correct its ownership with the following command:

      # chown root FILE
