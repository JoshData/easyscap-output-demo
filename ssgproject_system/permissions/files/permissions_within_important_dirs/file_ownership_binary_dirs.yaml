title: Verify that System Executables Have Root Ownership
description: |
  System executables are stored in the following directories by default:

      /bin
      /usr/bin
      /usr/local/bin
      /sbin
      /usr/sbin
      /usr/local/sbin

  All files in these directories should be owned by the `root` user. If
  any file *FILE* in these directories is found to be owned by a user
  other than root, correct its ownership with the following command:

      # chown root FILE
rationale: |
  System binaries are executed by privileged users as well as system
  services, and restrictive permissions are necessary to ensure that their
  execution of these programs cannot be co-opted.
