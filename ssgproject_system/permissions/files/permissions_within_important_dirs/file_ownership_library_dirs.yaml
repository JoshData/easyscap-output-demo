title: Verify that Shared Library Files Have Root Ownership
description: |
  System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables during
  process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
  by default:

      /lib
      /lib64
      /usr/lib
      /usr/lib64

  Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are
  also stored in `/lib/modules`. All files in these directories should be
  owned by the `root` user. If the directory, or any file in these
  directories, is found to be owned by a user other than root correct its
  ownership with the following command:

      # chown root FILE
rationale: |
  Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address space
  of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
  runtime. Proper ownership is necessary to protect the integrity of the
  system.
