title: Verify that Shared Library Files Have Restrictive Permissions
description: |
  System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables during
  process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories
  by default:

      /lib
      /lib64
      /usr/lib
      /usr/lib64

  Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are
  stored in `/lib/modules`. All files in these directories should not be
  group-writable or world-writable. If any file in these directories is
  found to be group-writable or world-writable, correct its permission
  with the following command:

      # chmod go-w FILE
rationale: |
  Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address space
  of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at
  runtime. Restrictive permissions are necessary to protect the integrity
  of the system.
