title: Verify that All World-Writable Directories Have Sticky Bits Set
description: |
  When the so-called ‘sticky bit’ is set on a directory, only the owner of
  a given file may remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky
  bit, any user with write access to a directory may remove any file in
  the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from removing each
  other’s files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be
  world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather
  than to set the sticky bit. However, if a directory is used by a
  particular application, consult that application’s documentation instead
  of blindly changing modes. \
   To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory *DIR*, run the
  following command:

      # chmod +t DIR
rationale: |
  Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized
  users to delete files in the directory structure.

  The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories
  supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file
  repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by
  the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as `/tmp`), and
  for directories requiring global read/write access.
