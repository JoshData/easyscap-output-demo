title: Verify that All World-Writable Directories Have Sticky Bits Set
description: |
  \
   To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory *DIR*, run the
  following command:

      # chmod +t DIR
rationale: |
  \
  \
   The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories
  supplied with the system, or those designed to be temporary file
  repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by
  the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as `/tmp`), and
  for directories requiring global read/write access.
