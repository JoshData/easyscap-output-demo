title: Verify User Who Owns shadow File
description: |
  To properly set the owner of `/etc/shadow`, run the command:

  ~~~~ {xml:space="preserve"}
  # chown root/etc/shadow
  ~~~~
rationale: |
  The `/etc/shadow` file contains the list of local system accounts and
  stores password hashes. Protection of this file is critical for system
  security. Failure to give ownership of this file to root provides the
  designated owner with access to sensitive information which could weaken
  the system security posture.
