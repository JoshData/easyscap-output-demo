title: Verify Permissions on Files with Local Account Information and Credentials
description: |
  The default restrictive permissions for files which act as important
  security databases such as `passwd`, `shadow`, `group`, and `gshadow`
  files must be maintained. Many utilities need read access to the
  `passwd` file in order to function properly, but read access to the
  `shadow` file allows malicious attacks against system passwords, and
  should never be enabled.
