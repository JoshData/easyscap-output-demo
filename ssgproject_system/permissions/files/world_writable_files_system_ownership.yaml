title: Ensure All World-Writable Directories Are Owned by a System Account
description: |
  All directories in local partitions which are world-writable should be
  owned by root or another system account. If any world-writable
  directories are not owned by a system account, this should be
  investigated. Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to
  an appropriate group.
rationale: |
  Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is undesirable
  because it allows the owner of that directory to remove or replace any
  files that may be placed in the directory by other users.
