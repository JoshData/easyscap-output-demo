title: Ensure All SUID Executables Are Authorized
description: |
  The SUID (set user id) bit should be set only on files that were
  installed via authorized means. A straightforward means of identifying
  unauthorized SGID files is determine if any were not installed as part
  of an RPM package, which is cryptographically verified. Investigate the
  origin of any unpackaged SUID files.
rationale: |
  Executable files with the SUID permission run with the privileges of the
  owner of the file. SUID files of uncertain provenance could allow for
  unprivileged users to elevate privileges. The presence of these files
  should be strictly controlled on the system.
