title: Bind Mount /var/tmp To /tmp
description: |
  The `/var/tmp` directory is a world-writable directory. Bind-mount it to
  `/tmp` in order to consolidate temporary storage into one location
  protected by the same techniques as `/tmp`. To do so, edit `/etc/fstab`
  and add the following line:

      /tmp     /var/tmp     none     rw,nodev,noexec,nosuid,bind     0 0

  See the `mount(8)` man page for further explanation of bind mounting.
rationale: |
  Having multiple locations for temporary storage is not required. Unless
  absolutely necessary to meet requirements, the storage location
  `/var/tmp` should be bind mounted to `/tmp` and thus share the same
  protections.
