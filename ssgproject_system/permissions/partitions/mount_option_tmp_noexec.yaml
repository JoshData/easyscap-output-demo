title: Add noexec Option to /tmp
description: |
  The `noexec` mount option can be used to prevent binaries from being
  executed out of `/tmp`. Add the `noexec` option to the fourth column of
  `/etc/fstab` for the line which controls mounting of `/tmp`.
rationale: |
  Allowing users to execute binaries from world-writable directories such
  as `/tmp` should never be necessary in normal operation and can expose
  the system to potential compromise.
