title: Add nodev Option to Non-Root Local Partitions
description: |
  `nodev` mount option prevents files from being interpreted as character
  or block devices. Legitimate character and block devices should exist
  only in the `/dev` directory on the root partition or within chroot
  jails built for system services. Add the `nodev` option to the fourth
  column of `/etc/fstab` for the line which controls mounting of any
  non-root local partitions.
rationale: |
  `nodev` mount option prevents files from being interpreted as character
  or block devices. The only legitimate location for device files is the
  `/dev` directory located on the root partition. The only exception to
  this is chroot jails, for which it is not advised to set `nodev` on
  these filesystems.
