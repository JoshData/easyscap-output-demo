title: Add nodev Option to Non-Root Local Partitions
description: |
  The `nodev` mount option prevents files from being interpreted as
  character or block devices. Legitimate character and block devices
  should exist only in the `/dev` directory on the root partition or
  within chroot jails built for system services. Add the `nodev` option to
  the fourth column of `/etc/fstab` for the line which controls mounting
  of any non-root local partitions.
rationale: |
  The `nodev` mount option prevents files from being interpreted as
  character or block devices. The only legitimate location for device
  files is the `/dev` directory located on the root partition. The only
  exception to this is chroot jails, for which it is not advised to set
  `nodev` on these filesystems.
