title: Add nodev Option to /tmp
description: |
  The `nodev` mount option can be used to prevent device files from being
  created in `/tmp`. Legitimate character and block devices should not
  exist within temporary directories like `/tmp`. Add the `nodev` option
  to the fourth column of `/etc/fstab` for the line which controls
  mounting of `/tmp`.
rationale: |
  The only legitimate location for device files is the `/dev` directory
  located on the root partition. The only exception to this is chroot
  jails.
