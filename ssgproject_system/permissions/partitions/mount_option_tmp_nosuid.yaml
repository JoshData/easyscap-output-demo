title: Add nosuid Option to /tmp
description: |
  The `nosuid` mount option can be used to prevent execution of setuid
  programs in `/tmp`. The suid/sgid permissions should not be required in
  these world-writable directories. Add the `nosuid` option to the fourth
  column of `/etc/fstab` for the line which controls mounting of `/tmp`.
rationale: |
  The presence of suid and sgid executables should be tightly controlled.
  Users should not be able to execute suid or sgid binaries from temporary
  storage partitions.
