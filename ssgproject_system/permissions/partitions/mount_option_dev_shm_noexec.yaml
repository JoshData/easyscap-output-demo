title: Add noexec Option to /dev/shm
description: |
  The `noexec` mount option can be used to prevent binaries from being
  executed out of `/dev/shm`. It can be dangerous to allow the execution
  of binaries from world-writable temporary storage directories such as
  `/dev/shm`. Add the `noexec` option to the fourth column of `/etc/fstab`
  for the line which controls mounting of `/dev/shm`.
rationale: |
  Allowing users to execute binaries from world-writable directories such
  as `/dev/shm` can expose the system to potential compromise.
