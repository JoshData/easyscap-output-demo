title: Add nodev Option to /dev/shm
description: |
  The `nodev` mount option can be used to prevent creation of device files
  in `/dev/shm`. Legitimate character and block devices should not exist
  within temporary directories like `/dev/shm`. Add the `nodev` option to
  the fourth column of `/etc/fstab` for the line which controls mounting
  of `/dev/shm`.
rationale: |
  The only legitimate location for device files is the `/dev` directory
  located on the root partition. The only exception to this is chroot
  jails.
