title: Disable Booting from USB Devices in Boot Firmware
description: |
  Configure the system boot firmware (historically called BIOS on PC
  systems) to disallow booting from USB drives.
rationale: |
  Booting a system from a USB device would allow an attacker to circumvent
  any security measures provided by the operating system. Attackers could
  mount partitions and modify the configuration of the OS.
