title: Disable All GNOME Thumbnailers
description: |
  The system’s default desktop environment, GNOME, uses a number of
  different thumbnailer programs to generate thumbnails for any new or
  modified content in an opened folder. The following command can disable
  the execution of these thumbnail applications:

      # gconftool-2 --direct \
        --config-source xml:readwrite:/etc/gconf/gconf.xml.mandatory \
        --type bool \
        --set /desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/disable_all true

  This effectively prevents an attacker from gaining access to a system
  through a flaw in GNOME’s Nautilus thumbnail creators.
rationale: |
  An attacker with knowledge of a flaw in a GNOME thumbnailer application
  could craft a malicious file to exploit this flaw. Assuming the attacker
  could place the malicious file on the local filesystem (via a web upload
  for example) and assuming a user browses the same location using
  Nautilus, the malicious file would exploit the thumbnailer with the
  potential for malicious code execution. It is best to disable these
  thumbnailer applications unless they are explicitly required.
