title: Assign Password to Prevent Changes to Boot Firmware Configuration
description: |
  Assign a password to the system boot firmware (historically called BIOS
  on PC systems) to require a password for any configuration changes.
rationale: |
  Assigning a password to the system boot firmware prevents anyone with
  physical access from configuring the system to boot from local media and
  circumvent the operating systemâ€™s access controls. For systems in
  physically secure locations, such as a data center or Sensitive
  Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), this risk must be weighed
  against the risk of administrative personnel being unable to conduct
  recovery operations in a timely fashion.
