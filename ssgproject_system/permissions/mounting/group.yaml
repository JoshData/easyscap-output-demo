title: |-
  Restrict Dynamic Mounting and Unmounting of
  Filesystems
description: |
  Linux includes a number of facilities for the automated addition and
  removal of filesystems on a running system. These facilities may be
  necessary in many environments, but this capability also carries some
  risk – whether direct risk from allowing users to introduce arbitrary
  filesystems, or risk that software flaws in the automated mount facility
  itself could allow an attacker to compromise the system.

  <p>
  This command can be used to list the types of filesystems that are
  available to the currently executing kernel:

      # find /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs -type f -name '*.ko'

  If these filesystems are not required then they can be explicitly
  disabled in a configuratio file in `/etc/modprobe.d`.
