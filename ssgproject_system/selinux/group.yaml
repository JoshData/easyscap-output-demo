title: SELinux
description: |
  SELinux is a feature of the Linux kernel which can be used to guard
  against misconfigured or compromised programs. SELinux enforces the idea
  that programs should be limited in what files they can access and what
  actions they can take.

  The default SELinux policy, as configured on RHEL 6, has been
  sufficiently developed and debugged that it should be usable on almost
  any Red Hat machine with minimal configuration and a small amount of
  system administrator training. This policy prevents system services -
  including most of the common network-visible services such as mail
  servers, FTP servers, and DNS servers - from accessing files which those
  services have no valid reason to access. This action alone prevents a
  huge amount of possible damage from network attacks against services,
  from trojaned software, and so forth.

  This guide recommends that SELinux be enabled using the default
  (targeted) policy on every Red Hat system, unless that system has
  unusual requirements which make a stronger policy appropriate.
