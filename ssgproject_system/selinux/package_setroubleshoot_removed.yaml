title: Uninstall setroubleshoot Package
description: |
  The SETroubleshoot service notifies desktop users of SELinux denials.
  The service provides information around configuration errors,
  unauthorized intrusions, and other potential errors. The
  `setroubleshoot` package can be removed with the following command:

      # yum erase setroubleshoot
rationale: |
  The SETroubleshoot service is an unnecessary daemon to have running on a
  server
