severity: low
title: Uninstall mcstrans Package
description: |
  The `mcstransd` daemon provides category label information to client
  processes requesting information. The label translations are defined in
  `/etc/selinux/targeted/setrans.conf`. The `mcstrans` package can be
  removed with the following command:

      # yum erase mcstrans
rationale: |
  Since this service is not used very often, disable it to reduce the
  amount of potentially vulnerable code running on the system. NOTE: This
  rule was added in support of the CIS RHEL6 v1.2.0 benchmark. Please note
  that Red Hat does not feel this rule is security relevant.
