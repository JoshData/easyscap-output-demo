title: Enable rsyslog to Accept Messages via UDP, if Acting As Log Server
description: |
  The `rsyslog` daemon should not accept remote messages unless the system
  acts as a log server. If the system needs to act as a central log
  server, add the following lines to `/etc/rsyslog.conf` to enable
  reception of messages over UDP:

      $ModLoad imudp
      $UDPServerRun 514
rationale: |
  Many devices, such as switches, routers, and other Unix-like systems,
  may only support the traditional syslog transmission over UDP. If the
  system must act as a log server, this enables it to receive their
  messages as well.
