title: Enable rsyslog to Accept Messages via TCP, if Acting As Log Server
description: |
  The `rsyslog` daemon should not accept remote messages unless the system
  acts as a log server. If the system needs to act as a central log
  server, add the following lines to `/etc/rsyslog.conf` to enable
  reception of messages over TCP:

      $ModLoad imtcp
      $InputTCPServerRun 514
rationale: |
  If the system needs to act as a log server, this ensures that it can
  receive messages over a reliable TCP connection.
