title: Configure rsyslogd to Accept Remote Messages If Acting as a Log Server
description: |
  `rsyslog` does not listen over the network for log messages. If needed,
  modules can be enabled to allow the rsyslog daemon to receive messages
  from other systems and for the system thus to act as a log server. If
  the machine is not a log server, then lines concerning these modules
  should remain commented out. \
