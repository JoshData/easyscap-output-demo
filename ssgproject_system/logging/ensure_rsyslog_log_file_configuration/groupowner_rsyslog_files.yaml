title: Ensure Log Files Are Owned By Appropriate Group
description: |
  The group-owner of all log files written by `rsyslog` should be root.
  These log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in
  `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and typically all appear in `/var/log`. For each log
  file *LOGFILE* referenced in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, run the following
  command to inspect the fileâ€™s group owner:

      $ ls -l LOGFILE

  If the owner is not `root`, run the following command to correct this:

      # chgrp root LOGFILE
rationale: |
  The log files generated by rsyslog contain valuable information
  regarding system configuration, user authentication, and other such
  information. Log files should be protected from unauthorized access.
