title: Ensure System Log Files Have Correct Permissions
description: |
  The file permissions for all log files written by `rsyslog` should be
  set to 600, or more restrictive. These log files are determined by the
  second part of each Rule line in `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and typically all
  appear in `/var/log`. For each log file *LOGFILE* referenced in
  `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, run the following command to inspect the fileâ€™s
  permissions:

      $ ls -l LOGFILE

  If the permissions are not 600 or more restrictive, run the following
  command to correct this:

      # chmod 0600 LOGFILE
rationale: |
  Log files can contain valuable information regarding system
  configuration. If the system log files are not protected unauthorized
  users could change the logged data, eliminating their forensic value.
