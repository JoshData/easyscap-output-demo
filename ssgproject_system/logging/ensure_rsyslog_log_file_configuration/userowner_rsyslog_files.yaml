title: Ensure Log Files Are Owned By Appropriate User
description: |
  The owner of all log files written by `rsyslog` should be root. These
  log files are determined by the second part of each Rule line in
  `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and typically all appear in `/var/log`. For each log
  file *LOGFILE* referenced in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, run the following
  command to inspect the fileâ€™s owner:

      $ ls -l LOGFILE

  If the owner is not `root`, run the following command to correct this:

      # chown root LOGFILE
rationale: |
  The log files generated by rsyslog contain valuable information
  regarding system configuration, user authentication, and other such
  information. Log files should be protected from unauthorized access.
