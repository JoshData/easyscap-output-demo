title: Ensure Log Files Are Owned By Appropriate User
description: |
  `rsyslog` should be root. These log files are determined by the second
  part of each Rule line in `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and typically all appear
  in `/var/log`. For each log file *LOGFILE* referenced in
  `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, run the following command to inspect the fileâ€™s
  owner:

      $ ls -l LOGFILE

  If the owner is not `root`, run the following command to correct this:

      # chown root LOGFILE
