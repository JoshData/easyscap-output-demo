title: Ensure Proper Configuration of Log Files
description: |
  The file `/etc/rsyslog.conf` controls where log message are written.
  These are controlled by lines called *rules*, which consist of a
  *selector* and an *action*. These rules are often customized depending
  on the role of the system, the requirements of the environment, and
  whatever may enable the administrator to most effectively make use of
  log data. The default rules in RHEL 6 are:

      *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages
      authpriv.*                                              /var/log/secure
      mail.*                                                  -/var/log/maillog
      cron.*                                                  /var/log/cron
      *.emerg                                                 *
      uucp,news.crit                                          /var/log/spooler
      local7.*                                                /var/log/boot.log

  See the man page `rsyslog.conf(5)` for more information. *Note that the
  `rsyslog` daemon can be configured to use a timestamp format that some
  log processing programs may not understand. If this occurs, edit the
  file `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and add or edit the following line:*

      $ ActionFileDefaultTemplate RSYSLOG_TraditionalFileFormat
rules:
- userowner_rsyslog_files
- groupowner_rsyslog_files
- rsyslog_file_permissions
