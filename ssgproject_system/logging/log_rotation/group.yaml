title: Ensure All Logs are Rotated by logrotate
description: |
  Edit the file `/etc/logrotate.d/syslog`. Find the first line, which
  should look like this (wrapped for clarity):

      /var/log/messages /var/log/secure /var/log/maillog /var/log/spooler \
        /var/log/boot.log /var/log/cron {

  Edit this line so that it contains a one-space-separated listing of each
  log file referenced in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.

  All logs in use on a system must be rotated regularly, or the log files
  will consume disk space over time, eventually interfering with system
  operation. The file `/etc/logrotate.d/syslog` is the configuration file
  used by the `logrotate` program to maintain all log files written by
  `syslog`. By default, it rotates logs weekly and stores four archival
  copies of each log. These settings can be modified by editing
  `/etc/logrotate.conf`, but the defaults are sufficient for purposes of
  this guide.

  Note that `logrotate` is run nightly by the cron job
  `/etc/cron.daily/logrotate`. If particularly active logs need to be
  rotated more often than once a day, some other mechanism must be used.
