title: Ensure Logs Sent To Remote Host
description: |
  To configure rsyslog to send logs to a remote log server, open
  `/etc/rsyslog.conf` and read and understand the last section of the
  file, which describes the multiple directives necessary to activate
  remote logging. Along with these other directives, the system can be
  configured to forward its logs to a particular log server by adding or
  correcting one of the following lines, substituting
  `loghost.example.com` appropriately. The choice of protocol depends on
  the environment of the system; although TCP and RELP provide more
  reliable message delivery, they may not be supported in all
  environments. \
   To use UDP for log message delivery:

      *.* @loghost.example.com

  \
   To use TCP for log message delivery:

      *.* @@loghost.example.com

  \
   To use RELP for log message delivery:

      *.* :omrelp:loghost.example.com
rationale: |
  A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more
  systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event
  a system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log
  messages to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a
  centralized place to view the status of multiple hosts within the
  enterprise.
