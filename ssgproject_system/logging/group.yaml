title: Configure Syslog
description: |
  The syslog service has been the default Unix logging mechanism for many
  years. It has a number of downsides, including inconsistent log format,
  lack of authentication for received messages, and lack of
  authentication, encryption, or reliable transport for messages sent over
  a network. However, due to its long history, syslog is a de facto
  standard which is supported by almost all Unix applications.

  In RHEL 6, rsyslog has replaced ksyslogd as the syslog daemon of choice,
  and it includes some additional security features such as reliable,
  connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log
  to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a
  central logging server. This section discusses how to configure rsyslog
  for best effect, and how to use tools provided with the system to
  maintain and monitor logs.
