title: ' Disable Logwatch on Clients if a Logserver Exists'
description: "Does your site have a central logserver which has been configured to\nreport
  on logs received from all systems? If so:\n\n     \n    # rm /etc/cron.daily/0logwatch
  \n\nIf no logserver exists, it will be necessary for each machine to run\nLogwatch
  individually. Using a central logserver provides the security\nand reliability benefits
  discussed earlier, and also makes monitoring\nlogs easier and less time-intensive
  for administrators.\n"
