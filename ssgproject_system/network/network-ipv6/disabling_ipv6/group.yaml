title: Disable Support for IPv6 Unless Needed
description: |
  Despite configuration that suggests support for IPv6 has been disabled,
  link-local IPv6 address auto-configuration occurs even when only an IPv4
  address is assigned. The only way to effectively prevent execution of
  the IPv6 networking stack is to instruct the system not to activate the
  IPv6 kernel module.
