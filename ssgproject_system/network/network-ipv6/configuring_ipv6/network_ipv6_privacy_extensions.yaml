title: Use Privacy Extensions for Address
description: |
  To introduce randomness into the automatic generation of IPv6 addresses,
  add or correct the following line in
  `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-interface`:

      IPV6_PRIVACY=rfc3041

  Automatically-generated IPv6 addresses are based on the underlying
  hardware (e.g. Ethernet) address, and so it becomes possible to track a
  piece of hardware over its lifetime using its traffic. If it is
  important for a systemâ€™s IP address to not trivially reveal its hardware
  address, this setting should be applied.
