title: Manually Assign Global IPv6 Address
description: |
  To manually assign an IP address for an interface, edit the file
  `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-interface`. Add or correct the
  following line (substituting the correct IPv6 address):

      IPV6ADDR=2001:0DB8::ABCD/64

  Manually assigning an IP address is preferable to accepting one from
  routers or from the network otherwise. The example address here is an
  IPv6 address reserved for documentation purposes, as defined by RFC3849.
