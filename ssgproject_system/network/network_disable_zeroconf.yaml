title: Disable Zeroconf Networking
description: |
  Zeroconf networking allows the system to assign itself an IP address and
  engage in IP communication without a statically-assigned address or even
  a DHCP server. Automatic address assignment via Zeroconf (or DHCP) is
  not recommended. To disable Zeroconf automatic route assignment in the
  169.254.0.0 subnet, add or correct the following line in
  `/etc/sysconfig/network`:

      NOZEROCONF=yes
rationale: |
  Zeroconf addresses are in the network 169.254.0.0. The networking
  scripts add entries to the systemâ€™s routing table for these addresses.
  Zeroconf address assignment commonly occurs when the system is
  configured to use DHCP but fails to receive an address assignment from
  the DHCP server.
