title: Set Default ip6tables Policy for Incoming Packets
description: |
  To set the default policy to DROP (instead of ACCEPT) for the built-in
  INPUT chain which processes incoming packets, add or correct the
  following line in `/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables`:

      :INPUT DROP [0:0]
rationale: |
  In `ip6tables` the default policy is applied only after all the
  applicable rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the
  default policy to `DROP` implements proper design for a firewall, i.e.
  any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.
