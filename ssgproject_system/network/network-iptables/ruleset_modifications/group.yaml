title: Strengthen the Default Ruleset
description: |
  The default rules can be strengthened. The system scripts that activate
  the firewall rules expect them to be defined in the configuration files
  iptables and ip6tables in the directory `/etc/sysconfig`. Many of the
  lines in these files are similar to the command line arguments that
  would be provided to the programs `/sbin/iptables` or `/sbin/ip6tables`
  - but some are quite different.

  The following recommendations describe how to strengthen the default
  ruleset configuration file. An alternative to editing this configuration
  file is to create a shell script that makes calls to the iptables
  program to load in rules, and then invokes service iptables save to
  write those loaded rules to `/etc/sysconfig/iptables.`

  The following alterations can be made directly to
  `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` and `/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables`. Instructions
  apply to both unless otherwise noted. Language and address conventions
  for regular iptables are used throughout this section; configuration for
  ip6tables will be either analogous or explicitly covered.
