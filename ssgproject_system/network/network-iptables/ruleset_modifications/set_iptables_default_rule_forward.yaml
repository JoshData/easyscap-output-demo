title: Set Default iptables Policy for Forwarded Packets
description: |
  To set the default policy to DROP (instead of ACCEPT) for the built-in
  FORWARD chain which processes packets that will be forwarded from one
  interface to another, add or correct the following line in
  `/etc/sysconfig/iptables`:

      :FORWARD DROP [0:0]
rationale: |
  In `iptables` the default policy is applied only after all the
  applicable rules in the table are examined for a match. Setting the
  default policy to `DROP` implements proper design for a firewall, i.e.
  any packets which are not explicitly permitted should not be accepted.
