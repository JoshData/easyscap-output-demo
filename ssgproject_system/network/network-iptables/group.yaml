title: iptables and ip6tables
description: |
  A host-based firewall called Netfilter is included as part of the Linux
  kernel distributed with the system. It is activated by default. This
  firewall is controlled by the program iptables, and the entire
  capability is frequently referred to by this name. An analogous program
  called ip6tables handles filtering for IPv6.

  Unlike TCP Wrappers, which depends on the network server program to
  support and respect the rules written, Netfilter filtering occurs at the
  kernel level, before a program can even process the data from the
  network packet. As such, any program on the system is affected by the
  rules written.

  This section provides basic information about strengthening the iptables
  and ip6tables configurations included with the system. For more complete
  information that may allow the construction of a sophisticated ruleset
  tailored to your environment, please consult the references at the end
  of this section.
