title: Deactivate Wireless Network Interfaces
description: |
  Deactivating wireless network interfaces should prevent normal usage of
  the wireless capability.

  <p>
  First, identify the interfaces available with the command:

      # ifconfig -a

  Additionally,the following command may also be used to determine whether
  wireless support (’extensions’) is included for a particular interface,
  though this may not always be a clear indicator:

      # iwconfig

  After identifying any wireless interfaces (which may have names like
  `wlan0`, `ath0`, `wifi0`, `em1` or `eth0`), deactivate the interface
  with the command:

      # ifdown interface

  These changes will only last until the next reboot. To disable the
  interface for future boots, remove the appropriate interface file from
  `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`:

      # rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-interface
rationale: |
  Wireless networking allows attackers within physical proximity to launch
  network-based attacks against systems, including those against local LAN
  protocols which were not designed with security in mind.
