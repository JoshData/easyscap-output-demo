title: Wireless Networking
description: |
  Wireless networking, such as 802.11 (WiFi) and Bluetooth, can present a
  security risk to sensitive or classified systems and networks. Wireless
  networking hardware is much more likely to be included in laptop or
  portable systems than desktops or servers.

  Removal of hardware provides the greatest assurance that the wireless
  capability remains disabled. Acquisition policies often include
  provisions to prevent the purchase of equipment that will be used in
  sensitive spaces and includes wireless capabilities. If it is
  impractical to remove the wireless hardware, and policy permits the
  device to enter sensitive spaces as long as wireless is disabled,
  efforts should instead focus on disabling wireless capability via
  software.
