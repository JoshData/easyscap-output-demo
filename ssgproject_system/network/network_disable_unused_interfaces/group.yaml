title: Disable Unused Interfaces
description: |
  \
  \
   If the system does not require network communications but still needs
  to use the loopback interface, remove all files of the form
  `ifcfg-interface` except for `ifcfg-lo` from
  `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`:

      # rm /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-interface

  If the system is a standalone machine with no need for network access or
  even communication over the loopback device, then disable this service.
  The `network` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig network off
