title: Transport Layer Security Support
description: |
  Support for Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its predecessor, the
  Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is included in RHEL in the OpenSSL software
  (RPM package `openssl`). TLS provides encrypted and authenticated
  network communications, and many network services include support for
  it. TLS or SSL can be leveraged to avoid any plaintext transmission of
  sensitive data. \
   For information on how to use OpenSSL, see
  **http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/**. Information on FIPS validation
  of OpenSSL is available at
  **http://www.openssl.org/docs/fips/fipsvalidation.html** and
  **http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm**.
