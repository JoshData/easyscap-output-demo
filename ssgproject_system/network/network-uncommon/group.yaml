title: Uncommon Network Protocols
description: |
  The system includes support for several network protocols which are not
  commonly used. Although security vulnerabilities in kernel networking
  code are not frequently discovered, the consequences can be dramatic.
  Ensuring uncommon network protocols are disabled reduces the systemâ€™s
  risk to attacks targeted at its implementation of those protocols.
