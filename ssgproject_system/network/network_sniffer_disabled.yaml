title: Ensure System is Not Acting as a Network Sniffer
description: |
  The system should not be acting as a network sniffer, which can capture
  all traffic on the network to which it is connected. Run the following
  to determine if any interface is running in promiscuous mode:

      $ ip link | grep PROMISC
rationale: |
  If any results are returned, then a sniffing process (such as tcpdump or
  Wireshark) is likely to be using the interface and this should be
  investigated.
