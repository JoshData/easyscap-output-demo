title: Require Authentication for Single User Mode
description: |
  Single-user mode is intended as a system recovery method, providing a
  single user root access to the system by providing a boot option at
  startup. By default, no authentication is performed if single-user mode
  is selected.

  <p>
  To require entry of the root password even if the system is started in
  single-user mode, add or correct the following line in the file
  `/etc/sysconfig/init`:

      SINGLE=/sbin/sulogin
rationale: |
  This prevents attackers with physical access from trivially bypassing
  security on the machine and gaining root access. Such accesses are
  further prevented by configuring the bootloader password.
