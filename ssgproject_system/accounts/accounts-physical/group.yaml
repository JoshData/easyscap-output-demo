title: Protect Physical Console Access
description: |
  It is impossible to fully protect a system from an attacker with
  physical access, so securing the space in which the system is located
  should be considered a necessary step. However, there are some steps
  which, if taken, make it more difficult for an attacker to quickly or
  undetectably modify a system from its console.
rules:
- require_singleuser_auth
- disable_ctrlaltdel_reboot
- disable_interactive_boot
subgroups:
- bootloader
- screen_locking
