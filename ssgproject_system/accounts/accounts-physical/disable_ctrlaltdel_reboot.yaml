title: Disable Ctrl-Alt-Del Reboot Activation
description: |
  By default, the system includes the following line in
  `/etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf` to reboot the system when the
  Ctrl-Alt-Del key sequence is pressed:

      exec /sbin/shutdown -r now "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"

  \
   To configure the system to log a message instead of rebooting the
  system, alter that line to read as follows:

      exec /usr/bin/logger -p security.info "Control-Alt-Delete pressed"
rationale: |
  A locally logged-in user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Del, when at the console,
  can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the
  case of mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term
  loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the
  GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the
  Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted
  before any action is taken. NOTE: When updating the `initscripts`
  package on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 system, custom changes to
  `/etc/init/control-alt-delete.conf` may be overwritten. Refer to
  https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/70464 for additional
  information.
