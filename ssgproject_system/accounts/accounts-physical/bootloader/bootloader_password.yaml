title: Set Boot Loader Password
description: |
  The grub boot loader should have password protection enabled to protect
  boot-time settings. To do so, select a password and then generate a hash
  from it by running the following command:

      # grub-crypt --sha-512

  When prompted to enter a password, insert the following line into
  `/etc/grub.conf` immediately after the header comments. (Use the output
  from `grub-crypt` as the value of **password-hash**):

      password --encrypted password-hash

  NOTE: To meet FISMA Moderate, the bootloader password MUST differ from
  the root password.
rationale: |
  Password protection on the boot loader configuration ensures users with
  physical access cannot trivially alter important bootloader settings.
  These include which kernel to use, and whether to enter single-user
  mode.
