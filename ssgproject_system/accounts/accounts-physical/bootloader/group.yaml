title: Set Boot Loader Password
description: |
  During the boot process, the boot loader is responsible for starting the
  execution of the kernel and passing options to it. The boot loader
  allows for the selection of different kernels - possibly on different
  partitions or media. The default RHEL boot loader for x86 systems is
  called GRUB. Options it can pass to the kernel include *single-user
  mode*, which provides root access without any authentication, and the
  ability to disable SELinux. To prevent local users from modifying the
  boot parameters and endangering security, protect the boot loader
  configuration with a password and ensure its configuration fileâ€™s
  permissions are set properly.
