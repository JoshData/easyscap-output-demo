title: Hardware Tokens for Authentication
description: |
  The use of hardware tokens such as smart cards for system login provides
  stronger, two-factor authentication than using a username/password. In
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers and workstations, hardware token login
  is not enabled by default and must be enabled in the system settings.
