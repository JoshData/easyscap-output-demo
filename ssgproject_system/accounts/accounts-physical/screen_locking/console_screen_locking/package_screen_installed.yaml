title: Install the screen Package
description: |
  To enable console screen locking, install the `screen` package:

      # yum install screen

  Instruct users to begin new terminal sessions with the following
  command:

      $ screen

  The console can now be locked with the following key combination:

      ctrl+a x
rationale: |
  Installing `screen` ensures a console locking capability is available
  for users who may need to suspend console logins.
