title: Configure GUI Screen Locking
description: |
  In the default GNOME desktop, the screen can be locked by choosing
  **Lock Screen** from the **System** menu.

  The `gconftool-2` program can be used to enforce mandatory screen
  locking settings for the default GNOME environment. The following
  sections detail commands to enforce idle activation of the screen saver,
  screen locking, a blank-screen screensaver, and an idle activation time.

  Because users should be trained to lock the screen when they step away
  from the computer, the automatic locking feature is only meant as a
  backup. The Lock Screen icon from the System menu can also be dragged to
  the taskbar in order to facilitate even more convenient screen-locking.

  The root account cannot be screen-locked, but this should
  <!-- TODO: is this still true? -->have no practical effect as the root
  account should *never* be used to log into an X Windows environment, and
  should only be used to for direct login via console in emergency
  circumstances.

  For more information about configuring GNOME screensaver, see
  http://live.gnome.org/GnomeScreensaver. For more information about
  enforcing preferences in the GNOME environment using the GConf
  configuration system, see http://projects.gnome.org/gconf and the man
  page `gconftool-2(1)`.
