title: Configure GUI Screen Locking
description: |
  **Lock Screen** from the **System** menu. \
  \
   The `gconftool-2` program can be used to enforce mandatory screen
  locking settings for the default GNOME environment. The following
  sections detail commands to enforce idle activation of the screen saver,
  screen locking, a blank-screen screensaver, and an idle activation time.
  \
  \
   Because users should be trained to lock the screen when they step away
  from the computer, the automatic locking feature is only meant as a
  backup. The Lock Screen icon from the System menu can also be dragged to
  the taskbar in order to facilitate even more convenient screen-locking.
  \
  \
   The root account cannot be screen-locked, but this should
  <!-- TODO: is this still true? -->have no practical effect as the root
  account should *never* be used to log into an X Windows environment, and
  should only be used to for direct login via console in emergency
  circumstances. \
