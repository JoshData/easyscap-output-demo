title: Ensure that User Home Directories are not Group-Writable or World-Readable
description: |
  For each human user of the system, view the permissions of the user’s
  home directory:

      # ls -ld /home/USER

  Ensure that the directory is not group-writable and that it is not
  world-readable. If necessary, repair the permissions:

      # chmod g-w /home/USER
      # chmod o-rwx /home/USER
rationale: |
  User home directories contain many configuration files which affect the
  behavior of a user’s account. No user should ever have write permission
  to another user’s home directory. Group shared directories can be
  configured in sub-directories or elsewhere in the filesystem if they are
  needed. Typically, user home directories should not be world-readable,
  as it would disclose file names to other users. If a subset of users
  need read access to one another’s home directories, this can be provided
  using groups or ACLs.
