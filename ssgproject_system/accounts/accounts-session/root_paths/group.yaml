title: Ensure that No Dangerous Directories Exist in Root's Path
description: |
  The active path of the root account can be obtained by starting a new
  root shell and running:

      # echo $PATH

  This will produce a colon-separated list of directories in the path.

  Certain path elements could be considered dangerous, as they could lead
  to root executing unknown or untrusted programs, which could contain
  malicious code. Since root may sometimes work inside untrusted
  directories, the `.` character, which represents the current directory,
  should never be in the root path, nor should any directory which can be
  written to by an unprivileged or semi-privileged (system) user.

  It is a good practice for administrators to always execute privileged
  commands by typing the full path to the command.
