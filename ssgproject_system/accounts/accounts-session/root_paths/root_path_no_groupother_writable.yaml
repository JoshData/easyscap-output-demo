title: Ensure that Root's Path Does Not Include World or Group-Writable Directories
description: |
  For each element in rootâ€™s path, run:

      # ls -ld DIR

  and ensure that write permissions are disabled for group and other.
rationale: |
  Such entries increase the risk that root could execute code provided by
  unprivileged users, and potentially malicious code.
