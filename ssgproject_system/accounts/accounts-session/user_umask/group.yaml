title: Ensure that Users Have Sensible Umask Values
description: |
  The umask setting controls the default permissions for the creation of
  new files. With a default `umask` setting of 077, files and directories
  created by users will not be readable by any other user on the system.
  Users who wish to make specific files group- or world-readable can
  accomplish this by using the chmod command. Additionally, users can make
  all their files readable to their group by default by setting a `umask`
  of 027 in their shell configuration files. If default per-user groups
  exist (that is, if every user has a default group whose name is the same
  as that userâ€™s username and whose only member is the user), then it may
  even be safe for users to select a `umask` of 007, making it very easy
  to intentionally share files with groups of which the user is a member.

  <!--In addition, it may be necessary to change root's <tt>umask</tt>
  temporarily in order to install software or files which must be
  readable by other users, or to change the default umasks of certain
  service accounts such as the FTP user. However, setting a
  restrictive default protects the files of users who have not taken
  steps to make their files more available, and preventing files from
  being inadvertently shared.-->
