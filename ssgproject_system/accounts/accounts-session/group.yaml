title: Secure Session Configuration Files for Login Accounts
description: |
  When a user logs into a Unix account, the system configures the user’s
  session by reading a number of files. Many of these files are located in
  the user’s home directory, and may have weak permissions as a result of
  user error or misconfiguration. If an attacker can modify or even read
  certain types of account configuration information, they can often gain
  full access to the affected user’s account. Therefore, it is important
  to test and correct configuration file permissions for interactive
  accounts, particularly those of privileged users such as root or system
  administrators.
