title: Limit the Number of Concurrent Login Sessions Allowed Per User
description: |
  Limiting the number of allowed users and sessions per user can limit
  risks related to Denial of Service attacks. This addresses concurrent
  sessions for a single account and does not address concurrent sessions
  by a single user via multiple accounts. The DoD requirement is 10. To
  set the number of concurrent sessions per user add the following line in
  `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

      * hard maxlogins 10
rationale: |
  Limiting simultaneous user logins can insulate the system from denial of
  service problems caused by excessive logins. Automated login processes
  operating improperly or maliciously may result in an exceptional number
  of simultaneous login sessions.
