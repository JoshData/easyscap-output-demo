title: Disable the User List
description: |
  In the default graphical environment, users logging directly into the
  system are greeted with a login screen that displays all known users.
  This functionality should be disabled.

  <p>
  Run the following command to disable the user list:

      sudo -u gdm gconftool-2 \
        --type bool \
        --set /apps/gdm/simple-greeter/disable_user_list true
rationale: |
  Leaving the user list enabled is a security risk since it allows anyone
  with physical access to the system to quickly enumerate known user
  accounts without logging in.
