title: Warning Banners for System Accesses
description: |
  \
  \
   System banners, which are typically displayed just before a login
  prompt, give out information about the service or the host’s operating
  system. This might include the distribution name and the system kernel
  version, and the particular version of a network service. This
  information can assist intruders in gaining access to the system as it
  can reveal whether the system is running vulnerable software. Most
  network services can be configured to limit what information is
  displayed. \
  \
   Many organizations implement security policies that require a system
  banner provide notice of the system’s ownership, provide warning to
  unauthorized users, and remind authorized users of their consent to
  monitoring.
