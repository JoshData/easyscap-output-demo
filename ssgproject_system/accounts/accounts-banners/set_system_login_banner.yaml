title: Modify the System Login Banner
description: >
  To configure the system login banner:


  Edit `/etc/issue`. Replace the default text with a message compliant

  with the local site policy or a legal disclaimer. The DoD required text

  is either:


  `You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided
  for USG-authorized use only. By using this IS (which includes any device attached
  to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:  -The USG routinely intercepts
  and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to,
  penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel
  misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations. 
  -At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.  -Communications
  using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject  to routine monitoring,
  interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used  for any USG-authorized purpose. 
  -This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) 
  to protect USG interests -- not for your personal benefit or privacy.  -Notwithstanding
  the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative
  searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product,
  related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or
  clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and
  confidential. See User Agreement for details.`


  OR:


  `I've read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't.`
rationale: |
  An appropriate warning message reinforces policy awareness during the
  logon process and facilitates possible legal action against attackers.
