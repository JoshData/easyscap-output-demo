title: Assign Expiration Date to Temporary Accounts
description: |
  In the event temporary or emergency accounts are required, configure the
  system to terminate them after a documented time period. For every
  temporary and emergency account, run the following command to set an
  expiration date on it, substituting `USER` and `YYYY-MM-DD`
  appropriately:

      # chage -E YYYY-MM-DD USER

  `YYYY-MM-DD` indicates the documented expiration date for the account.
rationale: |
  When temporary and emergency accounts are created, there is a risk they
  may remain in place and active after the need for them no longer exists.
  Account expiration greatly reduces the risk of accounts being misused or
  hijacked. \
