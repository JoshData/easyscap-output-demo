title: Set Account Expiration Parameters
description: |
  Accounts can be configured to be automatically disabled after a certain
  time period, meaning that they will require administrator interaction to
  become usable again. Expiration of accounts after inactivity can be set
  for all accounts by default and also on a per-account basis, such as for
  accounts that are known to be temporary. To configure automatic
  expiration of an account following the expiration of its password (that
  is, after the password has expired and not been changed), run the
  following command, substituting `NUM_DAYS` and `USER` appropriately:

      # chage -I NUM_DAYS USER

  Accounts, such as temporary accounts, can also be configured to expire
  on an explicitly-set date with the `-E` option. The file
  `/etc/default/useradd` controls default settings for all newly-created
  accounts created with the systemâ€™s normal command line utilities.
