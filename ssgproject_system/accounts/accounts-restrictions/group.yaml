title: Protect Accounts by Restricting Password-Based Login
description: |
  `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files. Password-based login is
  vulnerable to guessing of weak passwords, and to sniffing and
  man-in-the-middle attacks against passwords entered over a network or at
  an insecure console. Therefore, mechanisms for accessing accounts by
  entering usernames and passwords should be restricted to those which are
  operationally necessary.
