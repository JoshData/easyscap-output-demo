title: Protect Accounts by Restricting Password-Based Login
description: |
  Conventionally, Unix shell accounts are accessed by providing a username
  and password to a login program, which tests these values for
  correctness using the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` files.
  Password-based login is vulnerable to guessing of weak passwords, and to
  sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks against passwords entered over a
  network or at an insecure console. Therefore, mechanisms for accessing
  accounts by entering usernames and passwords should be restricted to
  those which are operationally necessary.
