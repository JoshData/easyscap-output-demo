title: Verify Only Root Has UID 0
description: |
  If any account other than root has a UID of 0, this misconfiguration
  should be investigated and the accounts other than root should be
  removed or have their UID changed.
rationale: |
  An account has root authority if it has a UID of 0. Multiple accounts
  with a UID of 0 afford more opportunity for potential intruders to guess
  a password for a privileged account. Proper configuration of sudo is
  recommended to afford multiple system administrators access to root
  privileges in an accountable manner.
