title: Restrict Web Browser Use for Administrative Accounts
description: |
  Enforce policy requiring administrative accounts use web browsers only
  for local service administration.
rationale: |
  If a browser vulnerability is exploited while running with
  administrative privileges, the entire system could be compromised.
  Specific exceptions for local service administration should be
  documented in site-defined policy.
