title: Restrict Root Logins
description: |
  Direct root logins should be allowed only for emergency use. In normal
  situations, the administrator should access the system via a unique
  unprivileged account, and then use `su` or `sudo` to execute privileged
  commands. Discouraging administrators from accessing the root account
  directly ensures an audit trail in organizations with multiple
  administrators. Locking down the channels through which root can connect
  directly also reduces opportunities for password-guessing against the
  root account. The `login` program uses the file `/etc/securetty` to
  determine which interfaces should allow root logins. The virtual devices
  `/dev/console` and `/dev/tty*` represent the system consoles (accessible
  via the Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F6 keyboard sequences on a default
  installation). The default securetty file also contains `/dev/vc/*`.
  These are likely to be deprecated in most environments, but may be
  retained for compatibility. Root should also be prohibited from
  connecting via network protocols. Other sections of this document
  include guidance describing how to prevent root from logging in via SSH.
