title: Restrict Root Logins
description: |
  `su` or `sudo` to execute privileged commands. Discouraging
  administrators from accessing the root account directly ensures an audit
  trail in organizations with multiple administrators. Locking down the
  channels through which root can connect directly also reduces
  opportunities for password-guessing against the root account. The
  `login` program uses the file `/etc/securetty` to determine which
  interfaces should allow root logins. The virtual devices `/dev/console`
  and `/dev/tty*` represent the system consoles (accessible via the
  Ctrl-Alt-F1 through Ctrl-Alt-F6 keyboard sequences on a default
  installation). The default securetty file also contains `/dev/vc/*`.
  These are likely to be deprecated in most environments, but may be
  retained for compatibility. Root should also be prohibited from
  connecting via network protocols. Other sections of this document
  include guidance describing how to prevent root from logging in via SSH.
