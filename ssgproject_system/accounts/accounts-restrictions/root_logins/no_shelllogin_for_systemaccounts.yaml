title: Ensure that System Accounts Do Not Run a Shell Upon Login
description: |
  Some accounts are not associated with a human user of the system, and
  exist to perform some administrative function. Should an attacker be
  able to log into these accounts, they should not be granted access to a
  shell.

  <p>
  The login shell for each local account is stored in the last field of
  each line in `/etc/passwd`. System accounts are those user accounts with
  a user ID less than 500. The user ID is stored in the third field. If
  any system account *SYSACCT* (other than root) has a login shell,
  disable it with the command:

      # usermod -s /sbin/nologin SYSACCT
rationale: |
  Ensuring shells are not given to system accounts upon login makes it
  more difficult for attackers to make use of system accounts.
