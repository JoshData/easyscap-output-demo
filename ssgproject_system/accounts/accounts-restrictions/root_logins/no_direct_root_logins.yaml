title: Direct root Logins Not Allowed
description: |
  To further limit access to the `root` account, administrators can
  disable root logins at the console by editing the `/etc/securetty` file.
  This file lists all devices the root user is allowed to login to. If the
  file does not exist at all, the root user can login through any
  communication device on the system, whether via the console or via a raw
  network interface. This is dangerous as user can login to his machine as
  root via Telnet, which sends the password in plain text over the
  network. By default, Red Hat Enteprise Linuxâ€™s `/etc/securetty` file
  only allows the root user to login at the console physically attached to
  the machine. To prevent root from logging in, remove the contents of
  this file. To prevent direct root logins, remove the contents of this
  file by typing the following command:

      echo > /etc/securetty
rationale: |
  Disabling direct root logins ensures proper accountability and
  multifactor authentication to privileged accounts. Users will first
  login, then escalate to privileged (root) access via su / sudo. This is
  required for FISMA Low and FISMA Moderate systems.
