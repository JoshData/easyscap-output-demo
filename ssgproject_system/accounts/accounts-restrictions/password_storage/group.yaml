  `/etc/shadow`. This file should be readable only by processes running
  with root credentials, preventing users from casually accessing others’
  password hashes and attempting to crack them. However, it remains
  possible to misconfigure the system and store password hashes in
  world-readable files such as `/etc/passwd`, or to even store passwords
  themselves in plaintext on the system. Using system-provided tools for
  password change/creation should allow administrators to avoid such
  misconfiguration.
