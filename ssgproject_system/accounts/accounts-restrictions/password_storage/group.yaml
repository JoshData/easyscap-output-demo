  Verify Proper Storage and Existence of Password
  Hashes
description: |
  By default, password hashes for local accounts are stored in the second
  field (colon-separated) in `/etc/shadow`. This file should be readable
  only by processes running with root credentials, preventing users from
  casually accessing othersâ€™ password hashes and attempting to crack them.
  However, it remains possible to misconfigure the system and store
  password hashes in world-readable files such as `/etc/passwd`, or to
  even store passwords themselves in plaintext on the system. Using
  system-provided tools for password change/creation should allow
  administrators to avoid such misconfiguration.
