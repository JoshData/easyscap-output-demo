title: Verify All Account Password Hashes are Shadowed
description: |
  If any password hashes are stored in `/etc/passwd` (in the second field,
  instead of an `x`), the cause of this misconfiguration should be
  investigated. The account should have its password reset and the hash
  should be properly stored, or the account should be deleted entirely.
rationale: |
  The hashes for all user account passwords should be stored in the file
  `/etc/shadow` and never in `/etc/passwd`, which is readable by all
  users.
