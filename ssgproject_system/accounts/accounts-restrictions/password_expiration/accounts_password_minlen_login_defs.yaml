title: Set Password Minimum Length in login.defs
description: |
  To specify password length requirements for new accounts, edit the file
  `/etc/login.defs` and add or correct the following lines:

      PASS_MIN_LEN 14

  The DoD requirement is `14`. The FISMA requirement is `12`. If a program
  consults `/etc/login.defs` and also another PAM module (such as
  `pam_cracklib`) during a password change operation, then the most
  restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section for more information
  about enforcing password quality requirements.
rationale: |
  Requiring a minimum password length makes password cracking attacks more
  difficult by ensuring a larger search space. However, any security
  benefit from an onerous requirement must be carefully weighed against
  usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive behavior that
  may result.
