title: Set Password Expiration Parameters
description: |
  `/etc/login.defs` controls several password-related settings. Programs
  such as `passwd`, `su`, and `login` consult `/etc/login.defs` to
  determine behavior with regard to password aging, expiration warnings,
  and length. See the man page `login.defs(5)` for more information. \
  \
   Users should be forced to change their passwords, in order to decrease
  the utility of compromised passwords. However, the need to change
  passwords often should be balanced against the risk that users will
  reuse or write down passwords if forced to change them too often.
  Forcing password changes every 90-360 days, depending on the
  environment, is recommended. Set the appropriate value as
  `PASS_MAX_DAYS` and apply it to existing accounts with the `-M` flag. \
  \
   The `PASS_MIN_DAYS` (`-m`) setting prevents password changes for 7 days
  after the first change, to discourage password cycling. If you use this
  setting, train users to contact an administrator for an emergency
  password change in case a new password becomes compromised. The
  `PASS_WARN_AGE` (`-W`) setting gives users 7 days of warnings at login
  time that their passwords are about to expire. \
  \
   For example, for each existing human user *USER*, expiration parameters
  could be adjusted to a 180 day maximum password age, 7 day minimum
  password age, and 7 day warning period with the following command:

      # chage -M 180 -m 7 -W 7 USER
