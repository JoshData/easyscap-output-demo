title: Set Last Logon/Access Notification
description: |
  To configure the system to notify users of last logon/access using
  `pam_lastlog`, add the following line immediately after
  `session  required  pam_limits.so`:

      session       required     pam_lastlog.so showfailed
rationale: |
  Users need to be aware of activity that occurs regarding their account.
  Providing users with information regarding the number of unsuccessful
  attempts that were made to login to their account allows the user to
  determine if any unauthorized activity has occurred and gives them an
  opportunity to notify administrators.
