title: Protect Accounts by Configuring PAM
description: |
  PAM, or Pluggable Authentication Modules, is a system which implements
  modular authentication for Linux programs. PAM provides a flexible and
  configurable architecture for authentication, and it should be
  configured to minimize exposure to unnecessary risk. This section
  contains guidance on how to accomplish that.

  PAM is implemented as a set of shared objects which are loaded and
  invoked whenever an application wishes to authenticate a user.
  Typically, the application must be running as root in order to take
  advantage of PAM, because PAM’s modules often need to be able to access
  sensitive stores of account information, such as /etc/shadow.
  Traditional privileged network listeners (e.g. sshd) or SUID programs
  (e.g. sudo) already meet this requirement. An SUID root application,
  userhelper, is provided so that programs which are not SUID or
  privileged themselves can still take advantage of PAM.

  PAM looks in the directory `/etc/pam.d` for application-specific
  configuration information. For instance, if the program login attempts
  to authenticate a user, then PAM’s libraries follow the instructions in
  the file `/etc/pam.d/login` to determine what actions should be taken.

  One very important file in `/etc/pam.d` is `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`.
  This file, which is included by many other PAM configuration files,
  defines ‘default’ system authentication measures. Modifying this file is
  a good way to make far-reaching authentication changes, for instance
  when implementing a centralized authentication service.
