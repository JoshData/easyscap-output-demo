title: Set Password Quality Requirements
description: |
  `pam_cracklib` PAM module provides strength checking for passwords. It
  performs a number of checks, such as making sure passwords are not
  similar to dictionary words, are of at least a certain length, are not
  the previous password reversed, and are not simply a change of case from
  the previous password. It can also require passwords to be in certain
  character classes. \
  \
   The `pam_passwdqc` PAM module also provides the ability to enforce
  stringent password strength requirements. It is provided in an RPM of
  the same name. \
  \
   The man pages `pam_cracklib(8)` and `pam_passwdqc(8)` provide
  information on the capabilities and configuration of each.
