title: Set Password Quality Requirements
description: |
  The default `pam_cracklib` PAM module provides strength checking for
  passwords. It performs a number of checks, such as making sure passwords
  are not similar to dictionary words, are of at least a certain length,
  are not the previous password reversed, and are not simply a change of
  case from the previous password. It can also require passwords to be in
  certain character classes.

  The `pam_passwdqc` PAM module also provides the ability to enforce
  stringent password strength requirements. It is provided in an RPM of
  the same name.

  The man pages `pam_cracklib(8)` and `pam_passwdqc(8)` provide
  information on the capabilities and configuration of each.
