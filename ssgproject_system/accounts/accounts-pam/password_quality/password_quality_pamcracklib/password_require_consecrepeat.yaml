title: Set Password to Maximum of Three Consecutive Repeating Characters
description: |
  `maxrepeat` parameter controls requirements for consecutive repeating
  characters. When set to a positive number, it will reject passwords
  which contain more than that number of consecutive characters. Add
  `maxrepeat=3` after pam\_cracklib.so to prevent a run of four or more
  identical characters.
