title: Set Password to Maximum of Three Consecutive Repeating Characters
description: |
  The pam\_cracklib moduleâ€™s `maxrepeat` parameter controls requirements
  for consecutive repeating characters. When set to a positive number, it
  will reject passwords which contain more than that number of consecutive
  characters. Add `maxrepeat=3` after pam\_cracklib.so to prevent a run of
  four or more identical characters.
rationale: |
  Passwords with excessive repeating characters may be more vulnerable to
  password-guessing attacks.
