title: Set Password Retry Prompts Permitted Per-Session
description: |
  To configure the number of retry prompts that are permitted per-session:

  Edit the `pam_cracklib.so` statement in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth` to show
  `retry=3`, or a lower value if site policy is more restrictive.

  The DoD requirement is a maximum of 3 prompts per session.
rationale: |
  Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session
  basis to a low value requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect.
  This can slow down and draw additional attention to some types of
  password-guessing attacks. Note that this is different from account
  lockout, which is provided by the pam\_faillock module.
