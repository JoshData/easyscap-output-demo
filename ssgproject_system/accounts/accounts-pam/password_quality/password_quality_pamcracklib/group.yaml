  Set Password Quality Requirements, if using
  pam_cracklib
description: |
  The `pam_cracklib` PAM module can be configured to meet requirements for
  a variety of policies.

  <p>
  For example, to configure `pam_cracklib` to require at least one
  uppercase character, lowercase character, digit, and other (special)
  character, locate the following line in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`:

      password requisite pam_cracklib.so try_first_pass retry=3

  and then alter it to read:

      password required pam_cracklib.so try_first_pass retry=3 maxrepeat=3 minlen=14 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1 difok=4

  If no such line exists, add one as the first line of the password
  section in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`. The arguments can be modified to
  ensure compliance with your organizationâ€™s security policy. Discussion
  of each parameter follows.
