title: Configure auditd Data Retention
description: |
  The audit system writes data to `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. By default,
  `auditd` rotates 5 logs by size (6MB), retaining a maximum of 30MB of
  data in total, and refuses to write entries when the disk is too full.
  This minimizes the risk of audit data filling its partition and
  impacting other services. This also minimizes the risk of the audit
  daemon temporarily disabling the system if it cannot write audit log
  (which it can be configured to do). For a busy system or a system which
  is thoroughly auditing system activity, the default settings for data
  retention may be insufficient. The log file size needed will depend
  heavily on what types of events are being audited. First configure
  auditing to log all the events of interest. Then monitor the log size
  manually for awhile to determine what file size will allow you to keep
  the required data for the correct time period.

  Using a dedicated partition for `/var/log/audit` prevents the `auditd`
  logs from disrupting system functionality if they fill, and, more
  importantly, prevents other activity in `/var` from filling the
  partition and stopping the audit trail. (The audit logs are size-limited
  and therefore unlikely to grow without bound unless configured to do
  so.) Some machines may have requirements that no actions occur which
  cannot be audited. If this is the case, then `auditd` can be configured
  to halt the machine if it runs out of space. **Note:** Since older logs
  are rotated, configuring `auditd` this way does not prevent older logs
  from being rotated away before they can be viewed. *If your system is
  configured to halt when logging cannot be performed, make sure this can
  never happen under normal circumstances! Ensure that `/var/log/audit` is
  on its own partition, and that this partition is larger than the maximum
  amount of data `auditd` will retain normally.*
