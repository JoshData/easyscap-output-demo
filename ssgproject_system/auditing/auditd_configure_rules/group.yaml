title: Configure auditd Rules for Comprehensive Auditing
description: |
  The `auditd` program can perform comprehensive monitoring of system
  activity. This section describes recommended configuration settings for
  comprehensive auditing, but a full description of the auditing system’s
  capabilities is beyond the scope of this guide. The mailing list
  *linux-audit@redhat.com* exists to facilitate community discussion of
  the auditing system.

  The audit subsystem supports extensive collection of events, including:
  \

  -   Tracing of arbitrary system calls (identified by name or number) on
      entry or exit.
  -   Filtering by PID, UID, call success, system call argument (with some
      limitations), etc.
  -   Monitoring of specific files for modifications to the file’s
      contents or metadata.

  \
   Auditing rules at startup are controlled by the file
  `/etc/audit/audit.rules`. Add rules to it to meet the auditing
  requirements for your organization. Each line in
  `/etc/audit/audit.rules` represents a series of arguments that can be
  passed to `auditctl` and can be individually tested during runtime. See
  documentation in `/usr/share/doc/audit-VERSION` and in the related man
  pages for more details.

  If copying any example audit rulesets from
  `/usr/share/doc/audit-VERSION`, be sure to comment out the lines
  containing `arch=` which are not appropriate for your system’s
  architecture. Then review and understand the following rules, ensuring
  rules are activated as needed for the appropriate architecture.

  <p>
  After reviewing all the rules, reading the following sections, and
  editing as needed, the new rules can be activated as follows:

      # service auditd restart
rules:
- audit_account_changes
- audit_network_modifications
- file_permissions_var_log_audit
- audit_logs_rootowner
- audit_mac_changes
- audit_manual_logon_edits
- audit_manual_session_edits
- audit_rules_unsuccessful_file_modification
- audit_privileged_commands
- audit_media_exports
- audit_rules_file_deletion_events
- audit_sysadmin_actions
- audit_kernel_module_loading
- audit_config_immutable
subgroups:
- audit_time_rules
- audit_dac_actions
