title: System Accounting with auditd
description: "The audit service provides substantial capabilities for recording system\nactivities.
  By default, the service audits about SELinux AVC denials and\ncertain types of security-relevant
  events such as system logins, account\nmodifications, and authentication events
  performed by programs such as\nsudo. Under its default configuration, `auditd` has
  modest disk space\nrequirements, and should not noticeably impact system performance.\n\n<p>\nGovernment
  networks often have substantial auditing requirements and\n`auditd` can be configured
  to meet these requirements. Examining some\nexample audit records demonstrates how
  the Linux audit system satisfies\ncommon requirements. The following example from
  Fedora Documentation\navailable at\n`http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/13/html/Security-Enhanced_Linux/sect-Security-Enhanced_Linux-Fixing_Problems-Raw_Audit_Messages.html`\nshows
  the substantial amount of information captured in a two typical\n“raw” audit messages,
  followed by a breakdown of the most important\nfields. In this example the message
  is SELinux-related and reports an\nAVC denial (and the associated system call) that
  occurred when the\nApache HTTP Server attempted to access the `/var/www/html/file1`
  file\n(labeled with the `samba_share_t` type):\n\n    type=AVC msg=audit(1226874073.147:96):
  avc:  denied  { getattr } for pid=2465 comm=\"httpd\"\n    path=\"/var/www/html/file1\"
  dev=dm-0 ino=284133 scontext=unconfined_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 \n    tcontext=unconfined_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0
  tclass=file\n\n    type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1226874073.147:96): arch=40000003 syscall=196
  success=no exit=-13 \n    a0=b98df198 a1=bfec85dc a2=54dff4 a3=2008171 items=0 ppid=2463
  pid=2465 auid=502 uid=48\n    gid=48 euid=48 suid=48 fsuid=48 egid=48 sgid=48 fsgid=48
  tty=(none) ses=6 comm=\"httpd\"\n    exe=\"/usr/sbin/httpd\" subj=unconfined_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0
  key=(null)\n\n-   `msg=audit(1226874073.147:96)`\n    -   The number in parentheses
  is the unformatted time stamp (Epoch\n        time) for the event, which can be
  converted to standard time by\n        using the `date` command.\n-   `{ getattr
  }`\n    -   The item in braces indicates the permission that was denied.\n        `getattr`
  indicates the source process was trying to read the\n        target file’s status
  information. This occurs before reading\n        files. This action is denied due
  to the file being accessed\n        having the wrong label. Commonly seen permissions
  include\n        `getattr`, `read`, and `write`.\n-   `comm=\"httpd\"`\n    -   The
  executable that launched the process. The full path of the\n        executable is
  found in the `exe=` section of the system call\n        (`SYSCALL`) message, which
  in this case, is\n        `exe=\"/usr/sbin/httpd\"`.\n-   `path=\"/var/www/html/file1\"`\n
  \   -   The path to the object (target) the process attempted to access.\n-   `scontext=\"unconfined_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0\"`\n
  \   -   The SELinux context of the process that attempted the denied\n        action.
  In this case, it is the SELinux context of the Apache\n        HTTP Server, which
  is running in the `httpd_t` domain.\n-   `tcontext=\"unconfined_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0\"`\n
  \   -   The SELinux context of the object (target) the process attempted\n        to
  access. In this case, it is the SELinux context of `file1`.\n        Note: the `samba_share_t`
  type is not accessible to processes\n        running in the `httpd_t` domain.\n-
  \  From the system call (`SYSCALL`) message, two items are of interest:\n    -   `success=no`:
  indicates whether the denial (AVC) was enforced or\n        not. `success=no` indicates
  the system call was not successful\n        (SELinux denied access). `success=yes`
  indicates the system call\n        was successful - this can be seen for permissive
  domains or\n        unconfined domains, such as `initrc_t` and `kernel_t`.\n    -
  \  `exe=\"/usr/sbin/httpd\"`: the full path to the executable that\n        launched
  the process, which in this case, is\n        `exe=\"/usr/sbin/httpd\"`.\n"
