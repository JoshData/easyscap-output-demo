title: A process for prompt installation of OS updates must exist.
description: |
  Procedures to promptly apply software updates must be established and
  executed. The Red Hat operating system provides support for automating
  such a process, by running the yum program through a cron job or by
  managing the system and its packages through the Red Hat Network or a
  Satellite Server.
rationale: This is a manual inquiry about update procedure.
