title: Deploy mod_ssl
description: |
  Because HTTP is a plain text protocol, all traffic is susceptible to
  passive monitoring. If there is a need for confidentiality, SSL should
  be configured and enabled to encrypt content.

  Note: `mod_nss` is a FIPS 140-2 certified alternative to `mod_ssl`. The
  modules share a considerable amount of code and should be nearly
  identical in functionality. If FIPS 140-2 validation is required, then
  `mod_nss` should be used. If it provides some feature or its greater
  compatibility is required, then `mod_ssl` should be used.
