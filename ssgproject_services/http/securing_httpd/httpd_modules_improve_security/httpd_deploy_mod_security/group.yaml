title: Deploy mod_security
description: |
  The `security` module provides an application level firewall for
  `httpd`. Following its installation with the base ruleset, specific
  configuration advice can be found at http://www.modsecurity.org/ to
  design a policy that best matches the security needs of the web
  applications. Usage of `mod_security` is highly recommended for some
  environments, but it should be noted this module does not ship with Red
  Hat Enterprise Linux itself, and instead is provided via Extra Packages
  for Enterprise Linux (EPEL). For more information on EPEL please refer
  to http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL.
