title: Run httpd in a chroot Jail if Practical
description: |
  `httpd` inside a `chroot` jail is designed to isolate the web server
  process to a small section of the filesystem, limiting the damage if it
  is compromised. Versions of Apache greater than 2.2.10 (such as the one
  included with RHEL 6) provide the `ChrootDir` directive. To run Apache
  inside a chroot jail in `/chroot/apache`, add the following line to
  `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:

      ChrootDir /chroot/apache

  This necessitates placing all files required by `httpd` inside
  `/chroot/apache` , including `httpd`’s binaries, modules, configuration
  files, and served web pages. The details of this configuration are
  beyond the scope of this guide. This may also require additional SELinux
  configuration.
