title: Limit Available Methods
description: |
  Web server methods are defined in section 9 of RFC 2616
  (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt). If a web server does not require
  the implementation of all available methods, they should be disabled.

  <p>
  Note: `GET` and `POST` are the most common methods. A majority of the
  others are limited to the WebDAV protocol.

      <Directory /var/www/html>
      # ...
         # Only allow specific methods (this command is case-sensitive!)
         <LimitExcept GET POST>
            Order allow,deny
         </LimitExcept>
      # ...
      </Directory>
rationale: |
  Minimizing the number of available methods to the web client reduces
  risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
