title: Restrict Other Critical Directories
description: |
  All accessible web directories should be configured with similarly
  restrictive settings. The `Options` directive should be limited to
  necessary functionality and the `AllowOverride` directive should be used
  only if needed. The `Order` and `Deny` access control tags should be
  used to deny access by default, allowing access only where necessary.
rationale: |
  Directories accessible from a web client should be configured with the
  least amount of access possible in order to avoid unauthorized access to
  restricted content or server information.
