title: Restrict Web Directory
description: |
  The default configuration for the web (`/var/www/html`) Directory allows
  directory indexing (`Indexes`) and the following of symbolic links
  (`FollowSymLinks`). Neither of these is recommended.

  The `/var/www/html` directory hierarchy should not be viewable via the
  web, and symlinks should only be followed if the owner of the symlink
  also owns the linked file.

  <p>
  Ensure that this policy is adhered to by altering the related section of
  the configuration:

      <Directory "/var/www/html">
      #  ...
         Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
      #  ...
      </Directory>
rationale: |
  Access to the web serverâ€™s directory hierarchy could allow access to
  unauthorized files by web clients. Following symbolic links could also
  allow such access.
