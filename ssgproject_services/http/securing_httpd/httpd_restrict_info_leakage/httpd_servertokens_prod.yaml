title: Set httpd ServerTokens Directive to Prod
description: |
  `ServerTokens Prod` restricts information in page headers, returning
  only the word “Apache.”

  <p>
  Add or correct the following directive in `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`:

      ServerTokens Prod
rationale: |
  Information disclosed to clients about the configuration of the web
  server and system could be used to plan an attack on the given system.
  This information disclosure should be restricted to a minimum.
