title: Disable Cache Support
description: |
  The `cache` module allows `httpd` to cache data, optimizing access to
  frequently accessed content. However, it introduces potential security
  flaws such as the possibility of circumventing `Allow` and `Deny`
  directives.

  <p>
  If this functionality is unnecessary, comment out the module:

      #LoadModule cache_module modules/mod_cache.so

  If caching is required, it should not be enabled for any limited-access
  content.
rationale: |
  Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server
  reduces risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
