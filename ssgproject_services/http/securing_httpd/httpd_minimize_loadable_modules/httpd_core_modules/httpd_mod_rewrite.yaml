title: Disable HTTP mod_rewrite
description: |
  The `mod_rewrite` module is very powerful and can protect against
  certain classes of web attacks. However, it is also very complex and has
  a significant history of vulnerabilities itself. If its functionality is
  unnecessary, comment out the related module:

      #LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so
rationale: |
  Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server
  reduces risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
