title: Disable Server Activity Status
description: |
  The `status` module provides real-time access to statistics on the
  internal operation of the web server. This may constitute an unnecessary
  information leak and should be disabled unless necessary. To do so,
  comment out the related module:

      #LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so

  If there is a critical need for this module, ensure that access to the
  status page is properly restricted to a limited set of hosts in the
  status handler configuration.
rationale: |
  Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server
  reduces risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
