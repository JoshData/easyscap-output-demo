title: Disable Server Side Includes
description: |
  Server Side Includes provide a method of dynamically generating web
  pages through the insertion of server-side code. However, the technology
  is also deprecated and introduces significant security concerns. If this
  functionality is unnecessary, comment out the related module:

      #LoadModule include_module modules/mod_include.so

  If there is a critical need for Server Side Includes, they should be
  enabled with the option `IncludesNoExec` to prevent arbitrary code
  execution. Additionally, user supplied data should be encoded to prevent
  cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
rationale: |
  Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server
  reduces risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
