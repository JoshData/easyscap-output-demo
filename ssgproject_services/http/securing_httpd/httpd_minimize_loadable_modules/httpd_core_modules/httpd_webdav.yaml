title: Disable WebDAV (Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
description: |
  WebDAV is an extension of the HTTP protocol that provides distributed
  and collaborative access to web content. If its functionality is
  unnecessary, comment out the related modules:

      #LoadModule dav_module modules/mod_dav.so
      #LoadModule dav_fs_module modules/mod_dav_fs.so

  If there is a critical need for WebDAV, extra care should be taken in
  its configuration. Since DAV access allows remote clients to manipulate
  server files, any location on the server that is DAV enabled should be
  protected by access controls.
rationale: |
  Minimizing the number of loadable modules available to the web server,
  reduces risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web server.
