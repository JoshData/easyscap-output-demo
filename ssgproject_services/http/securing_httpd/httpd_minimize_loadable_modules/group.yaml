title: Minimize Web Server Loadable Modules
description: |
  `httpd` includes a plethora of dynamically shared objects (DSO) that are
  loaded at run-time. Unlike the aforementioned compiled-in modules, a DSO
  can be disabled in the configuration file by removing the corresponding
  LoadModule directive. \
  \
   Note: A DSO only provides additional functionality if associated
  directives are included in the `httpd` configuration file. It should
  also be noted that removing a DSO will produce errors on `httpd` startup
  if the configuration file contains directives that apply to that module.
  Refer to `http://httpd.apache.org/docs/` for details on which directives
  are associated with each DSO. \
  \
   Following each DSO removal, the configuration can be tested with the
  following command to check if everything still works:

      # service httpd configtest

  The purpose of each of the modules loaded by default will now be
  addressed one at a time. If none of a module’s directives are being
  used, remove it.
