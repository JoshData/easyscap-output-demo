  The web server is responsible for providing access to content via the
  HTTP protocol. Web servers represent a significant security risk
  because:

  -   The HTTP port is commonly probed by malicious sources
  -   Web server software is very complex, and includes a long history of
      vulnerabilities
  -   The HTTP protocol is unencrypted and vulnerable to passive
      monitoring

  The systemâ€™s default web server software is Apache 2 and is provided in
  the RPM package `httpd`.
