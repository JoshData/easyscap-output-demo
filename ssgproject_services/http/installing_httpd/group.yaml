title: Install Apache if Necessary
description: |
  If `httpd` was not installed and activated, but the system needs to act
  as a web server, then it should be installed on the system. Follow these
  guidelines to install it defensively. The `httpd` package can be
  installed with the following command:

      # yum install httpd

  This method of installation is recommended over installing the “Web
  Server” package group during the system installation process. The Web
  Server package group includes many packages which are likely extraneous,
  while the command-line method installs only the required `httpd` package
  itself.
