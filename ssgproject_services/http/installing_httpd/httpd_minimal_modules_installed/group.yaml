title: Confirm Minimal Built-in Modules Installed
description: |
  The default `httpd` installation minimizes the number of modules that
  are compiled directly into the binary (`core prefork http_core mod_so`).
  This minimizes risk by limiting the capabilities allowed by the web
  server. Query the set of compiled-in modules using the following
  command:

      $ httpd -l

  If the number of compiled-in modules is significantly larger than the
  aforementioned set, this guide recommends re-installing `httpd` with a
  reduced configuration. Minimizing the number of modules that are
  compiled into the `httpd` binary, reduces risk by limiting the
  capabilities allowed by the webserver.
