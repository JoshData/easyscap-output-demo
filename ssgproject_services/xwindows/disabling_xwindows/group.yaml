title: Disable X Windows
description: |
  Unless there is a mission-critical reason for the system to run a
  graphical user interface, ensure X is not set to start automatically at
  boot and remove the X Windows software packages. There is usually no
  reason to run X Windows on a dedicated server machine, as it increases
  the systemâ€™s attack surface and consumes system resources.
  Administrators of server systems should instead login via SSH or on the
  text console.
