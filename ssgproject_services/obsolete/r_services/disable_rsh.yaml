title: Disable rsh Service
description: |
  The `rsh` service, which is available with the `rsh-server` package and
  runs as a service through xinetd, should be disabled. The `rsh` service
  can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig rsh off
rationale: |
  The rsh service uses unencrypted network communications, which means
  that data from the login session, including passwords and all other
  information transmitted during the session, can be stolen by
  eavesdroppers on the network.
