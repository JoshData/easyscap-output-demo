title: Disable rexec Service
description: |
  The `rexec` service, which is available with the `rsh-server` package
  and runs as a service through xinetd, should be disabled. The `rexec`
  service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig rexec off
rationale: |
  The rexec service uses unencrypted network communications, which means
  that data from the login session, including passwords and all other
  information transmitted during the session, can be stolen by
  eavesdroppers on the network.
