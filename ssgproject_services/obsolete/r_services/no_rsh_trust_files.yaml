title: Remove Rsh Trust Files
description: |
  The files `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `~/.rhosts` (in each userâ€™s home
  directory) list remote hosts and users that are trusted by the local
  system when using the rshd daemon. To remove these files, run the
  following command to delete them from any location:

      # rm /etc/hosts.equiv

      $ rm ~/.rhosts
rationale: |
  Trust files are convenient, but when used in conjunction with the
  R-services, they can allow unauthenticated access to a system.
