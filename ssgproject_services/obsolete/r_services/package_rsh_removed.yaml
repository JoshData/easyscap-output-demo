title: Uninstal rsh Package
description: The `rsh` package contains the client commands for the rsh services
rationale: |
  These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have been
  replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is
  removed, it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent
  users from inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore
  exposing their credentials. Note that removing the `rsh` package removes
  the clients for `rsh`,`rcp`, and `rlogin`.
