title: Remove telnet Clients
description: |
  The telnet client allows users to start connections to other systems via
  the telnet protocol.
rationale: |
  The `telnet` protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an
  unencrypted transmission medium could allow an unauthorized user to
  steal credentials. The `ssh` package provides an encrypted session and
  stronger security and is included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
