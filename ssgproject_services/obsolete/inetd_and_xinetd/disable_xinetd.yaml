title: Disable xinetd Service
description: |
  The `xinetd` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig xinetd off
rationale: |
  The xinetd service provides a dedicated listener service for some
  programs, which is no longer necessary for commonly-used network
  services. Disabling it ensures that these uncommon services are not
  running, and also prevents attacks against xinetd itself.
