title: Xinetd
description: |
  The `xinetd` service acts as a dedicated listener for some network
  services (mostly, obsolete ones) and can be used to provide access
  controls and perform some logging. It has been largely obsoleted by
  other features, and it is not installed by default. The older Inetd
  service is not even available as part of RHEL 6.
