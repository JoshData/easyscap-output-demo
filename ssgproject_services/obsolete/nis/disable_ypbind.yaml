title: Disable ypbind Service
description: |
  `ypbind` service, which allows the system to act as a client in a NIS or
  NIS+ domain, should be disabled. The `ypbind` service can be disabled
  with the following command:

      # chkconfig ypbind off
rationale: |
  `ypbind` service ensures the system is not acting as a client in a NIS
  or NIS+ domain.
