title: Disable ypbind Service
description: |
  The `ypbind` service, which allows the system to act as a client in a
  NIS or NIS+ domain, should be disabled. The `ypbind` service can be
  disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig ypbind off
rationale: |
  Disabling the `ypbind` service ensures the system is not acting as a
  client in a NIS or NIS+ domain.
