title: Remove NIS Client
description: |
  The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages,
  is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system
  configuration files. The NIS client (`ypbind`) was used to bind a
  machine to an NIS server and receive the distributed configuration
  files.
rationale: |
  The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been
  vulnerable to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication
  for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols
  as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that
  the service be removed.
