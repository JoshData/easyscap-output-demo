title: Obsolete Services
description: |
  This section discusses a number of network-visible services which have
  historically caused problems for system security, and for which
  disabling or severely limiting the service has been the best available
  guidance for some time. As a result of this, many of these services are
  not installed as part of RHEL 6 by default.

  Organizations which are running these services should switch to more
  secure equivalents as soon as possible. If it remains absolutely
  necessary to run one of these services for legacy reasons, care should
  be taken to restrict the service as much as possible, for instance by
  configuring host firewall software such as `iptables` to restrict access
  to the vulnerable service to only those remote hosts which have a known
  need to use it.
