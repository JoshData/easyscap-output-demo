title: Remove tftp
description: |
  Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple file transfer
  protocol, typically used to automatically transfer configuration or boot
  files between machines. TFTP does not support authentication and can be
  easily hacked. The package `tftp` is a client program that allows for
  connections to a `tftp` server.
rationale: |
  It is recommended that TFTP be remvoed, unless there is a specific need
  for TFTP (such as a boot server). In that case, use extreme caution when
  configuring the services.
