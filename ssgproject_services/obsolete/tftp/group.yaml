title: TFTP Server
description: |
  TFTP is a lightweight version of the FTP protocol which has
  traditionally been used to configure networking equipment. However, TFTP
  provides little security, and modern versions of networking operating
  systems frequently support configuration via SSH or other more secure
  protocols. A TFTP server should be run only if no more secure method of
  supporting existing equipment can be found.
