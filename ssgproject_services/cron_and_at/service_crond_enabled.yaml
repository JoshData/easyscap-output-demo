title: Enable cron Service
description: |
  The `crond` service is used to execute commands at preconfigured times.
  It is required by almost all systems to perform necessary maintenance
  tasks, such as notifying root of system activity. The `crond` service
  can be enabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig --level 2345 crond on
rationale: |
  Due to its usage for maintenance and security-supporting tasks, enabling
  the cron daemon is essential.
