title: Disable anacron Service
description: |
  The `cronie-anacron` package, which provides `anacron` functionality, is
  installed by default. The `cronie-anacron` package can be removed with
  the following command:

      # yum erase cronie-anacron
rationale: |
  The `anacron` service provides `cron` functionality for systems such as
  laptops and workstations that may be shut down during the normal times
  that `cron` jobs are scheduled to run. On systems which do not require
  this additional functionality, `anacron` could needlessly increase the
  possible attack surface for an intruder.
