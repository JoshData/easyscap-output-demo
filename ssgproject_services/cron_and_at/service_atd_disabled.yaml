title: Disable At Service (atd)
description: |
  The `at` and `batch` commands can be used to schedule tasks that are
  meant to be executed only once. This allows delayed execution in a
  manner similar to cron, except that it is not recurring. The daemon
  `atd` keeps track of tasks scheduled via `at` and `batch`, and executes
  them at the specified time. The `atd` service can be disabled with the
  following command:

      # chkconfig atd off
rationale: |
  The `atd` service could be used by an unsophisticated insider to carry
  out activities outside of a normal login session, which could complicate
  accountability. Furthermore, the need to schedule tasks with `at` or
  `batch` is not common.
