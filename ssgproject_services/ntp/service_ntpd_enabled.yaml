title: Enable the NTP Daemon
description: |
  The `ntpd` service can be enabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig --level 2345 ntpd on
rationale: |
  Enabling the `ntpd` service ensures that the `ntpd` service will be
  running and that the system will synchronize its time to any servers
  specified. This is important whether the system is configured to be a
  client (and synchronize only its own clock) or it is also acting as an
  NTP server to other systems. Synchronizing time is essential for
  authentication services such as Kerberos, but it is also important for
  maintaining accurate logs and auditing possible security breaches.

  The NTP daemon offers all of the functionality of `ntpdate`, which is
  now deprecated. Additional information on this is available at
  http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Dev/DeprecatingNtpdate
