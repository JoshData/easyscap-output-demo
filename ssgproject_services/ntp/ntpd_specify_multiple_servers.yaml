title: Specify Additional Remote NTP Servers
description: |
  Additional NTP servers can be specified for time synchronization in the
  file `/etc/ntp.conf`. To do so, add additional lines of the following
  form, substituting the IP address or hostname of a remote NTP server for
  *ntpserver*:

      server ntpserver
rationale: |
  Specifying additional NTP servers increases the availability of accurate
  time data, in the event that one of the specified servers becomes
  unavailable. This is typical for a system acting as an NTP server for
  other systems.
