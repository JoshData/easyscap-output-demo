title: Configure SNMP Server if Necessary
description: |
  If it is necessary to run the snmpd agent on the system, some best
  practices should be followed to minimize the security risk from the
  installation. The multiple security models implemented by SNMP cannot be
  fully covered here so only the following general configuration advice
  can be offered:

  -   use only SNMP version 3 security models and enable the use of
      authentication and encryption
  -   write access to the MIB (Management Information Base) should be
      allowed only if necessary
  -   all access to the MIB should be restricted following a principle of
      least privilege
  -   network access should be limited to the maximum extent possible
      including restricting to expected network addresses both in the
      configuration files and in the system firewall rules
  -   ensure SNMP agents send traps only to, and accept SNMP queries only
      from, authorized management stations
  -   ensure that permissions on the `snmpd.conf` configuration file (by
      default, in `/etc/snmp`) are 640 or more restrictive
  -   ensure that any MIB filesâ€™ permissions are also 640 or more
      restrictive
rules:
- snmpd_use_newer_protocol
- snmpd_not_default_password
