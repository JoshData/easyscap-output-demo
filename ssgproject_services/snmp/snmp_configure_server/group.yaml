title: Configure SNMP Server if Necessary
description: |
  -   use only SNMP version 3 security models and enable the use of
      authentication and encryption
  -   write access to the MIB (Management Information Base) should be
      allowed only if necessary
  -   all access to the MIB should be restricted following a principle of
      least privilege
  -   network access should be limited to the maximum extent possible
      including restricting to expected network addresses both in the
      configuration files and in the system firewall rules
  -   ensure SNMP agents send traps only to, and accept SNMP queries only
      from, authorized management stations
  -   ensure that permissions on the `snmpd.conf` configuration file (by
      default, in `/etc/snmp`) are 640 or more restrictive
  -   ensure that any MIB files’ permissions are also 640 or more
      restrictive
rules:
- snmpd_use_newer_protocol
- snmpd_not_default_password
