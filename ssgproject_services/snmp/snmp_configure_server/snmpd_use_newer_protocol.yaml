title: 'Configure SNMP Service to Use Only SNMPv3 or Newer '
description: |
  Edit `/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf`, removing any references to `v1`, `v2c`, or
  `com2sec`. Upon doing that, restart the SNMP service:

      # service snmpd restart
rationale: |
  Earlier versions of SNMP are considered insecure, as they potentially
  allow unauthorized access to detailed system management information.
