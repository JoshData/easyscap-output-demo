title: Uninstall net-snmp Package
description: |
  The `net-snmp` package provides the snmpd service. The `net-snmpd`
  package can be removed with the following command:

      # yum erase net-snmpd
rationale: |
  If there is no need to run SNMP server software, removing the package
  provides a safeguard against its activation.
