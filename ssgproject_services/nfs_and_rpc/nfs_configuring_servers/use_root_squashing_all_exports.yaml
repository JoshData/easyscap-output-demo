title: Use Root-Squashing on All Exports
description: |
  If a filesystem is exported using root squashing, requests from root on
  the client are considered to be unprivileged (mapped to a user such as
  nobody). This provides some mild protection against remote abuse of an
  NFS server. Root squashing is enabled by default, and should not be
  disabled.

  Ensure that no line in `/etc/exports` contains the option
  `no_root_squash`.
rationale: |
  If the NFS server allows root access to local file systems from remote
  hosts, this access could be used to compromise the system.
