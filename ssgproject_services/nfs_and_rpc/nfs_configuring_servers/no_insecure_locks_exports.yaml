title: Ensure Insecure File Locking is Not Allowed
description: |
  By default the NFS server requires secure file-lock requests, which
  require credentials from the client in order to lock a file. Most NFS
  clients send credentials with file lock requests, however, there are a
  few clients that do not send credentials when requesting a file-lock,
  allowing the client to only be able to lock world-readable files. To get
  around this, the `insecure_locks` option can be used so these clients
  can access the desired export. This poses a security risk by potentially
  allowing the client access to data for which it does not have
  authorization. Remove any instances of the `insecure_locks` option from
  the file `/etc/exports`.
rationale: |
  Allowing insecure file locking could allow for sensitive data to be
  viewed or edited by an unauthorized user.
