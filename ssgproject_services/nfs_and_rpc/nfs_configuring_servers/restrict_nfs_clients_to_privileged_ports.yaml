title: Restrict NFS Clients to Privileged Ports
description: |
  By default, the server NFS implementation requires that all client
  requests be made from ports less than 1024. If your organization has
  control over machines connected to its network, and if NFS requests are
  prohibited at the border firewall, this offers some protection against
  malicious requests from unprivileged users. Therefore, the default
  should not be changed.

  To ensure that the default has not been changed, ensure no line in
  `/etc/exports` contains the option `insecure`.
rationale: |
  Allowing client requests to be made from ports higher than 1024 could
  allow a unprivileged user to initiate an NFS connection. If the
  unprivileged user account has been compromised, an attacker could gain
  access to data on the NFS server.
