title: Configure the Exports File Restrictively
description: |
  Linuxâ€™s NFS implementation uses the file `/etc/exports` to control what
  filesystems and directories may be accessed via NFS. (See the
  `exports(5)` manpage for more information about the format of this
  file.)

  The syntax of the `exports` file is not necessarily checked fully on
  reload, and syntax errors can leave your NFS configuration more open
  than intended. Therefore, exercise caution when modifying the file.

  <p>
  The syntax of each line in `/etc/exports` is:

      /DIR   host1(opt1,opt2) host2(opt3)

  where `/DIR` is a directory or filesystem to export, `hostN` is an IP
  address, netblock, hostname, domain, or netgroup to which to export, and
  `optN` is an option.
