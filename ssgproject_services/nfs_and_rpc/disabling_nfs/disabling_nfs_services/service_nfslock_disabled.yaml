title: Disable Network File System Lock Service (nfslock)
description: |
  The Network File System Lock (nfslock) service starts the required
  remote procedure call (RPC) processes which allow clients to lock files
  on the server. If the local machine is not configured to mount NFS
  filesystems then this service should be disabled. The `nfslock` service
  can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig nfslock off
