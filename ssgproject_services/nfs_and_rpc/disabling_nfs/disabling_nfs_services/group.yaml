title: Disable Services Used Only by NFS
description: |
  If NFS is not needed, disable the NFS client daemons nfslock, rpcgssd,
  and rpcidmapd.

  All of these daemons run with elevated privileges, and many listen for
  network connections. If they are not needed, they should be disabled to
  improve system security posture.
