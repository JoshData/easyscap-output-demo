title: Disable Secure RPC Client Service (rpcgssd)
description: |
  The rpcgssd service manages RPCSEC GSS contexts required to secure
  protocols that use RPC (most often Kerberos and NFS). The rpcgssd
  service is the client-side of RPCSEC GSS. If the system does not require
  secure RPC then this service should be disabled. The `rpcgssd` service
  can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig rpcgssd off
