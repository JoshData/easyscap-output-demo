title: Disable RPC ID Mapping Service (rpcidmapd)
description: |
  The rpcidmapd service is used to map user names and groups to UID and
  GID numbers on NFSv4 mounts. If NFS is not in use on the local system
  then this service should be disabled. The `rpcidmapd` service can be
  disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig rpcidmapd off
