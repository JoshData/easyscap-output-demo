title: Mount Remote Filesystems with Restrictive Options
description: |
  Edit the file `/etc/fstab`. For each filesystem whose type (column 3) is
  `nfs` or `nfs4`, add the text `,nodev,nosuid` to the list of mount
  options in column 4. If appropriate, also add `,noexec`.

  See the section titled “Restrict Partition Mount Options” for a
  description of the effects of these options. In general, execution of
  files mounted via NFS should be considered risky because of the
  possibility that an adversary could intercept the request and substitute
  a malicious file. Allowing setuid files to be executed from remote
  servers is particularly risky, both for this reason and because it
  requires the clients to extend root-level trust to the NFS server.
