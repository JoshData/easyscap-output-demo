title: Disable Secure RPC Server Service (rpcsvcgssd)
description: |
  The rpcsvcgssd service manages RPCSEC GSS contexts required to secure
  protocols that use RPC (most often Kerberos and NFS). The rpcsvcgssd
  service is the server-side of RPCSEC GSS. If the system does not require
  secure RPC then this service should be disabled. The `rpcsvcgssd`
  service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig rpcsvcgssd off
rationale: |
  Unnecessary services should be disabled to decrease the attack surface
  of the system.
