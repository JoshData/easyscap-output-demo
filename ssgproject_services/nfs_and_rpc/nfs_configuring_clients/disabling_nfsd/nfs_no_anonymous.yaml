title: Specify UID and GID for Anonymous NFS Connections
description: |
  To specify the UID and GID for remote root users, edit the
  `/etc/exports` file and add the following for each export:

      anonuid=-1
      anongid=-1
rationale: |
  Specifying the anonymous UID and GID as -1 ensures that the remote root
  user is mapped to a local account which has no permissions on the
  system.
