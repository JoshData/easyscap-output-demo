title: Disable Network File System (nfs)
description: |
  The Network File System (NFS) service allows remote hosts to mount and
  interact with shared filesystems on the local machine. If the local
  machine is not designated as a NFS server then this service should be
  disabled. The `nfs` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig nfs off
rationale: |
  Unnecessary services should be disabled to decrease the attack surface
  of the system.
