title: Configure mountd to use static port
description: |
  Configure the `mountd` daemon to use a static port as opposed to letting
  the RPC Bind service dynamically assign a port. Edit the file
  `/etc/sysconfig/nfs`. Add or correct the following line:

      MOUNTD_PORT=statd-port

  Where `mountd-port` is a port which is not used by any other service on
  your network.
rationale: |
  Restricting services to always use a given port enables firewalling to
  be done more effectively.
