title: Configure statd to use static port
description: |
  `statd` daemon to use a static port as opposed to letting the RPC Bind
  service dynamically assign a port. Edit the file `/etc/sysconfig/nfs`.
  Add or correct the following line:

      STATD_PORT=statd-port

  Where `statd-port` is a port which is not used by any other service on
  your network.
