title: Make Each Machine a Client or a Server, not Both
description: |
  If NFS must be used, it should be deployed in the simplest configuration
  possible to avoid maintainability problems which may lead to unnecessary
  security exposure. Due to the reliability and security problems caused
  by NFS (specially NFSv3 and NFSv2), it is not a good idea for machines
  which act as NFS servers to also mount filesystems via NFS. At the
  least, crossed mounts (the situation in which each of two servers mounts
  a filesystem from the other) should never be used.
