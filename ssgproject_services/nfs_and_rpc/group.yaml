description: |
  The Network File System is a popular distributed filesystem for the Unix
  environment, and is very widely deployed. This section discusses the
  circumstances under which it is possible to disable NFS and its
  dependencies, and then details steps which should be taken to secure
  NFSâ€™s configuration. This section is relevant to machines operating as
  NFS clients, as well as to those operating as NFS servers.
