title: Configure Dovecot to Use the SSL Certificate file
description: |
  This option tells Dovecot where to find the the mail serverâ€™s SSL
  Certificate.

  <p>
  Edit `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf` and add or correct the following
  line (*note: the path below is the default path set by the Dovecot
  installation. If you are using a different path, ensure you reference
  the appropriate file*):

      ssl_cert = </etc/pki/dovecot/certs/dovecot.pem
rationale: |
  SSL certificates are used by the client to authenticate the identity of
  the server, as well as to encrypt credentials and message traffic. Not
  using SSL to encrypt mail server traffic could allow unauthorized access
  to credentials and mail messages since they are sent in plain text over
  the network.
