title: Enable the SSL flag in /etc/dovecot.conf
description: |
  To allow clients to make encrypted connections the `ssl` flag in
  Dovecotâ€™s configuration file needs to be set to `yes`.

  <p>
  Edit `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf` and add or correct the following
  line:

      ssl = yes
rationale: |
  SSL encrypt network traffic between the Dovecot server and its clients
  protecting user credentials, mail as it is downloaded, and clients may
  use SSL certificates to authenticate the server, preventing another
  system from impersonating the server.
