title: Enable SSL Support
description: |
  SSL should be used to encrypt network traffic between the Dovecot server
  and its clients. Users must authenticate to the Dovecot server in order
  to read their mail, and passwords should never be transmitted in clear
  text. In addition, protecting mail as it is downloaded is a privacy
  measure, and clients may use SSL certificates to authenticate the
  server, preventing another system from impersonating the server.
