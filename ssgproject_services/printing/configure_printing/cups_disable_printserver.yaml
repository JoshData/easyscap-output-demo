title: Disable Print Server Capabilities
description: |
  To prevent remote users from potentially connecting to and using locally
  configured printers, disable the CUPS print server sharing capabilities.
  To do so, limit how the server will listen for print jobs by removing
  the more generic port directive from /etc/cups/cupsd.conf:

      Port 631

  and replacing it with the `Listen` directive:

      Listen localhost:631

  This will prevent remote users from printing to locally configured
  printers while still allowing local users on the machine to print
  normally.
rationale: |
  By default, locally configured printers will not be shared over the
  network, but if this functionality has somehow been enabled, these
  recommendations will disable it again. Be sure to disable outgoing
  printer list broadcasts, or remote users will still be able to see the
  locally configured printers, even if they cannot actually print to them.
  To limit print serving to a particular set of users, use the Policy
  directive.
