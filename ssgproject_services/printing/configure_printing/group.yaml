title: Configure the CUPS Service if Necessary
description: |
  CUPS provides the ability to easily share local printers with other
  machines over the network. It does this by allowing machines to share
  lists of available printers. Additionally, each machine that runs the
  CUPS service can potentially act as a print server. Whenever possible,
  the printer sharing and print server capabilities of CUPS should be
  limited or disabled. The following recommendations should demonstrate
  how to do just that.
