title: Disable Printer Browsing Entirely if Possible
description: |
  By default, CUPS listens on the network for printer list broadcasts on
  UDP port 631. This functionality is called printer browsing. To disable
  printer browsing entirely, edit the CUPS configuration file, located at
  `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf`, to include the following:

      Browsing Off
rationale: |
  The CUPS print service can be configured to broadcast a list of
  available printers to the network. Other machines on the network, also
  running the CUPS print service, can be configured to listen to these
  broadcasts and add and configure these printers for immediate use. By
  disabling this browsing capability, the machine will no longer generate
  or receive such broadcasts.
