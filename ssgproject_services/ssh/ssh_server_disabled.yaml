title: Disable SSH Server If Possible (Unusual)
description: |
  The SSH server service, sshd, is commonly needed. However, if it can be
  disabled, do so. The `sshd` service can be disabled with the following
  command:

      # chkconfig sshd off

  This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and
  authenticated remote access.
