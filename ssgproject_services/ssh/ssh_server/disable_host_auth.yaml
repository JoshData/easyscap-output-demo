title: Disable Host-Based Authentication
description: |
  SSHâ€™s cryptographic host-based authentication is more secure than
  `.rhosts` authentication. However, it is not recommended that hosts
  unilaterally trust one another, even within an organization.

  <p>
  To disable host-based authentication, add or correct the following line
  in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

      HostbasedAuthentication no
rationale: |
  SSH trust relationships mean a compromise on one host can allow an
  attacker to move trivially to other hosts.
