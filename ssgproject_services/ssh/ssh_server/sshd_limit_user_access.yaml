title: Limit Users' SSH Access
description: |
  By default, the SSH configuration allows any user with an account to
  access the system. In order to specify the users that are allowed to
  login via SSH and deny all other users, add or correct the following
  line in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file:

      DenyUsers USER1 USER2

  Where `USER1` and `USER2` are valid user names.
rationale: |
  Specifying which accounts are allowed SSH access into the system reduces
  the possibility of unauthorized access to the system.
