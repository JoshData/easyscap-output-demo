title: Set SSH Idle Timeout Interval
description: |
  SSH allows administrators to set an idle timeout interval. After this
  interval has passed, the idle user will be automatically logged out.

  <p>
  To set an idle timeout interval, edit the following line in
  `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` as follows:

      ClientAliveInterval interval

  The timeout **interval** is given in seconds. To have a timeout of 15
  minutes, set **interval** to 900.

  If a shorter timeout has already been set for the login shell, that
  value will preempt any SSH setting made here. Keep in mind that some
  processes may stop SSH from correctly detecting that the user is idle.
rationale: |
  Causing idle users to be automatically logged out guards against
  compromises one system leading trivially to compromises on another.
