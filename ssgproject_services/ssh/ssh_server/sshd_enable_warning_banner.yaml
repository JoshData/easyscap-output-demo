title: Enable SSH Warning Banner
description: |
  To enable the warning banner and ensure it is consistent across the
  system, add or correct the following line in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

      Banner /etc/issue

  Another section contains information on how to create an appropriate
  system-wide warning banner.
rationale: |
  The warning message reinforces policy awareness during the logon process
  and facilitates possible legal action against attackers. Alternatively,
  systems whose ownership should not be obvious should ensure usage of a
  banner that does not provide easy attribution.
