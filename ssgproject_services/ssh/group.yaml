title: SSH Server
description: |
  The SSH protocol is recommended for remote login and remote file
  transfer. SSH provides confidentiality and integrity for data exchanged
  between two systems, as well as server authentication, through the use
  of public key cryptography. The implementation included with the system
  is called OpenSSH, and more detailed documentation is available from its
  website, http://www.openssh.org. Its server program is called `sshd` and
  provided by the RPM package `openssh-server`.
