title: Configure OpenLDAP Clients
description: |
  This section provides information on which security settings are
  important to configure in OpenLDAP clients by manually editing the
  appropriate configuration files. RHEL 6 provides an automated
  configuration tool called authconfig and a graphical wrapper for
  authconfig called `system-config-authentication`. However, these tools
  do not provide as much control over configuration as manual editing of
  configuration files. The authconfig tools do not allow you to specify
  locations of SSL certificate files, which is useful when trying to use
  SSL cleanly across several protocols. Installation and configuration of
  OpenLDAP on RHEL 6 is available at
  https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red\_Hat\_Enterprise\_Linux/6/html/Deployment\_Guide/ch-Directory\_Servers.html.
