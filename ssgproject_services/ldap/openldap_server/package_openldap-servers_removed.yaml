title: Uninstall openldap-servers Package
description: |
  The `openldap-servers` package should be removed if not in use. Is this
  machine the OpenLDAP server? If not, remove the package.

      # yum erase openldap-servers

  The openldap-servers RPM is not installed by default on RHEL 6 machines.
  It is needed only by the OpenLDAP server, not by the clients which use
  LDAP for authentication. If the system is not intended for use as an
  LDAP Server it should be removed.
rationale: |
  Unnecessary packages should not be installed to decrease the attack
  surface of the system. While this software is clearly essential on an
  LDAP server, it is not necessary on typical desktop or workstation
  systems.
