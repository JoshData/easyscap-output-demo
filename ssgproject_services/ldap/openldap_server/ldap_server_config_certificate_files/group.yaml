title: Install and Protect LDAP Certificate Files
description: |
  Create the PKI directory for LDAP certificates if it does not already
  exist:

      # mkdir /etc/pki/tls/ldap
      # chown root:root /etc/pki/tls/ldap
      # chmod 755 /etc/pki/tls/ldap

  Using removable media or some other secure transmission format, install
  the certificate files onto the LDAP server:

  -   `/etc/pki/tls/ldap/serverkey.pem`: the private key
      `ldapserverkey.pem`
  -   `/etc/pki/tls/ldap/servercert.pem`: the certificate file
      `ldapservercert.pem`

  Verify the ownership and permissions of these files:

      # chown root:ldap /etc/pki/tls/ldap/serverkey.pem
      # chown root:ldap /etc/pki/tls/ldap/servercert.pem
      # chmod 640 /etc/pki/tls/ldap/serverkey.pem
      # chmod 640 /etc/pki/tls/ldap/servercert.pem

  Verify that the CAâ€™s public certificate file has been installed as
  `/etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem`, and has the correct permissions:

      # mkdir /etc/pki/tls/CA
      # chown root:root /etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem
      # chmod 644 /etc/pki/tls/CA/cacert.pem

  As a result of these steps, the LDAP server will have access to its own
  private certificate and the key with which that certificate is
  encrypted, and to the public certificate file belonging to the CA. Note
  that it would be possible for the key to be protected further, so that
  processes running as ldap could not read it. If this were done, the LDAP
  server process would need to be restarted manually whenever the server
  rebooted.
