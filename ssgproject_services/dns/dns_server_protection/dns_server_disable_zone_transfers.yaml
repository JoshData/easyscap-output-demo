title: Disable Zone Transfers from the Nameserver
description: |
  Is it necessary for a secondary nameserver to receive zone data via zone
  transfer from the primary server? If not, follow the instructions in
  this section. If so, see the next section for instructions on protecting
  zone transfers. Add or correct the following directive within
  `/etc/named.conf`:

      options {
        allow-transfer { none; };
        ...
      }
rationale: |
  If both the primary and secondary nameserver are under your control, or
  if you have only one nameserver, it may be possible to use an external
  configuration management mechanism to distribute zone updates. In that
  case, it is not necessary to allow zone transfers within BIND itself, so
  they should be disabled to avoid the potential for abuse.
