title: Use Views to Partition External and Internal Information
description: |
  If it is not possible to run external and internal nameservers on
  separate physical machines, run BIND9 and simulate this feature using
  views. Edit `/etc/named.conf`. Add or correct the following directives
  (where SUBNET is the numerical IP representation of your organization in
  the form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx):

      acl internal {
        SUBNET ;
        localhost;
      };
      view "internal-view" {
        match-clients { internal; };
        zone "." IN {
          type hint;
          file "db.cache";
        };
        zone "internal.example.com " IN {
          ...
        };
      };

      view "external-view" {
        match-clients { any; };
        recursion no;
        zone "example.com " IN {
          ...
        };
      };
