title: Disable Dynamic Updates
description: |
  Is there a mission-critical reason to enable the risky dynamic update
  functionality? If not, edit `/etc/named.conf`. For each zone
  specification, correct the following directive if necessary:

      zone "example.com " IN {
        allow-update { none; };
        ...
      };
rationale: |
  Dynamic updates allow remote servers to add, delete, or modify any
  entries in your zone file. Therefore, they should be considered highly
  risky, and disabled unless there is a very good reason for their use. If
  dynamic updates must be allowed, IP-based ACLs are insufficient
  protection, since they are easily spoofed. Instead, use TSIG keys (see
  the previous section for an example), and consider using the
  update-policy directive to restrict changes to only the precise type of
  change needed.
