title: Authenticate Zone Transfers
description: |
  If it is necessary for a secondary nameserver to receive zone data via
  zone transfer from the primary server, follow the instructions here. Use
  dnssec-keygen to create a symmetric key file in the current directory:

      # cd /tmp
      # dnssec-keygen -a HMAC-MD5 -b 128 -n HOST dns.example.com
      Kdns.example.com .+aaa +iiiii

  This output is the name of a file containing the new key. Read the file
  to find the base64-encoded key string:

      # cat Kdns.example.com .+NNN +MMMMM .key
      dns.example.com IN KEY 512 3 157 base64-key-string

  Add the directives to `/etc/named.conf` on the primary server:

      key zone-transfer-key {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "base64-key-string ";
      };
      zone "example.com " IN {
        type master;
        allow-transfer { key zone-transfer-key; };
        ...
      };

  Add the directives below to `/etc/named.conf` on the secondary
  nameserver:

      key zone-transfer-key {
        algorithm hmac-md5;
        secret "base64-key-string ";
      };

      server IP-OF-MASTER {
        keys { zone-transfer-key; };
      };

      zone "example.com " IN {
        type slave;
        masters { IP-OF-MASTER ; };
        ...
      };
rationale: |
  The BIND transaction signature (TSIG) functionality allows primary and
  secondary nameservers to use a shared secret to verify authorization to
  perform zone transfers. This method is more secure than using IP-based
  limiting to restrict nameserver access, since IP addresses can be easily
  spoofed. However, if you cannot configure TSIG between your servers
  because, for instance, the secondary nameserver is not under your
  control and its administrators are unwilling to configure TSIG, you can
  configure an allow-transfer directive with numerical IP addresses or
  ACLs as a last resort.
