title: Samba(SMB) Microsoft Windows File Sharing Server
description: |
  `samba-client`, provides a series of command line tools that enable a
  client machine to access Samba shares. The second, simply labeled
  `samba`, provides the Samba service. It is this second package that
  allows a Linux machine to act as an Active Directory server, a domain
  controller, or as a domain member. Only the `samba-client` package is
  installed by default.
