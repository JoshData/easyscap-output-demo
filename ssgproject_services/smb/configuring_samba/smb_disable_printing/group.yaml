title: Restrict Printer Sharing
description: |
  By default, Samba utilizes the CUPS printing service to enable printer
  sharing with Microsoft Windows workstations. If there are no printers on
  the local machine, or if printer sharing with Microsoft Windows is not
  required, disable the printer sharing capability by commenting out the
  following lines, found in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`:

      [global]
        load printers = yes
        cups options = raw
      [printers]
        comment = All Printers
        path = /usr/spool/samba
        browseable = no
        guest ok = no
        writable = no
        printable = yes

  There may be other options present, but these are the only options
  enabled and uncommented by default. Removing the `[printers]` share
  should be enough for most users. If the Samba printer sharing capability
  is needed, consider disabling the Samba network browsing capability or
  restricting access to a particular set of users or network addresses.
  Set the `valid users` parameter to a small subset of users or restrict
  it to a particular group of users with the shorthand `@`. Separate each
  user or group of users with a space. For example, under the `[printers]`
  share:

      [printers]
        valid users = user @printerusers
rules: []
subgroups: []
