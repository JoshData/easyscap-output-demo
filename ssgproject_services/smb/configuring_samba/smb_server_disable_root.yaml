title: Disable Root Access to SMB Shares
description: |
  Administrators should not use administrator accounts to access Samba
  file and printer shares. Disable the root user and the wheel
  administrator group:

      [share]
        invalid users = root @wheel

  If administrator accounts cannot be disabled, ensure that local machine
  passwords and Samba service passwords do not match.
rationale: |
  Typically, administrator access is required when Samba must create user
  and machine accounts and shares. Domain member servers and standalone
  servers may not need administrator access at all. If that is the case,
  add the invalid users parameter to `[global]` instead.
