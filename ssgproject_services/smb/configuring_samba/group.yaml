title: Configure Samba if Necessary
description: |
  All settings for the Samba daemon can be found in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`.
  Settings are divided between a `[global]` configuration section and a
  series of user created share definition sections meant to describe file
  or print shares on the system. By default, Samba will operate in user
  mode and allow client machines to access local home directories and
  printers. It is recommended that these settings be changed or that
  additional limitations be set in place.
