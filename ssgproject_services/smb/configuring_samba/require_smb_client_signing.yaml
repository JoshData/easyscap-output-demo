title: Require Client SMB Packet Signing, if using smbclient
description: |
  To require samba clients running `smbclient` to use packet signing, add
  the following to the `[global]` section of the Samba configuration file,
  `/etc/samba/smb.conf`:

      client signing = mandatory

  Requiring samba clients such as `smbclient` to use packet signing
  ensures they can only communicate with servers that support packet
  signing.
rationale: |
  Packet signing can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks which modify SMB
  packets in transit.
