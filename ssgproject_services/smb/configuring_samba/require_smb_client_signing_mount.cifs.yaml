title: Require Client SMB Packet Signing, if using mount.cifs
description: |
  Require packet signing of clients who mount Samba shares using the
  `mount.cifs` program (e.g., those who specify shares in `/etc/fstab`).
  To do so, ensure signing options (either `sec=krb5i` or `sec=ntlmv2i`)
  are used.

  See the `mount.cifs(8)` man page for more information. A Samba client
  should only communicate with servers who can support SMB packet signing.
rationale: |
  Packet signing can prevent man-in-the-middle attacks which modify SMB
  packets in transit.
