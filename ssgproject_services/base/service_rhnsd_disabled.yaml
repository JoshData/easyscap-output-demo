title: Disable Red Hat Network Service (rhnsd)
description: |
  The Red Hat Network service automatically queries Red Hat Network
  servers to determine whether there are any actions that should be
  executed, such as package updates. This only occurs if the system was
  registered to an RHN server or satellite and managed as such. The
  `rhnsd` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig rhnsd off
rationale: |
  Although systems management and patching is extremely important to
  system security, management by a system outside the enterprise enclave
  is not desirable for some environments. However, if the system is being
  managed by RHN or RHN Satellite Server the `rhnsd` daemon can remain on.
