title: Disable D-Bus IPC Service (messagebus)
description: |
  D-Bus provides an IPC mechanism used by a growing list of programs, such
  as those used for Gnome, Bluetooth, and Avahi. Due to these
  dependencies, disabling D-Bus may not be practical for many systems. The
  `messagebus` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig messagebus off
rationale: |
  If no services which require D-Bus are needed, then it can be disabled.
  As a broker for IPC between processes of different privilege levels, it
  could be a target for attack. However, disabling D-Bus is likely to be
  impractical for any system which needs to provide a graphical login
  session.
