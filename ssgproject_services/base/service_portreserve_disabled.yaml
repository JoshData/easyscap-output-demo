title: Disable Portreserve (portreserve)
description: |
  The `portreserve` service is a TCP port reservation utility that can be
  used to prevent portmap from binding to well known TCP ports that are
  required for other services. The `portreserve` service can be disabled
  with the following command:

      # chkconfig portreserve off
rationale: |
  The `portreserve` service provides helpful functionality by preventing
  conflicting usage of ports in the reserved port range, but it can be
  disabled if not needed.
