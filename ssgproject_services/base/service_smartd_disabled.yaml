title: Disable SMART Disk Monitoring Service (smartd)
description: |
  SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) is a feature
  of hard drives that allows them to detect symptoms of disk failure and
  relay an appropriate warning. The `smartd` service can be disabled with
  the following command:

      # chkconfig smartd off
rationale: |
  SMART can help protect against denial of service due to failing
  hardware. Nevertheless, if it is not needed or the systemâ€™s drives are
  not SMART-capable (such as solid state drives), it can be disabled.
