title: Disable CPU Speed (cpuspeed)
description: |
  The `cpuspeed` service can adjust the clock speed of supported CPUs
  based upon the current processing load thereby conserving power and
  reducing heat. The `cpuspeed` service can be disabled with the following
  command:

      # chkconfig cpuspeed off
rationale: |
  The `cpuspeed` service is only necessary if adjusting the CPU clock
  speed provides benefit. Traditionally this has included laptops (to
  enhance battery life), but may also apply to server or desktop
  environments where conserving power is highly desirable or necessary.
