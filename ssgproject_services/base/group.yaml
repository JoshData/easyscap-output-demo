title: Base Services
description: |
  This section addresses the base services that are installed on a RHEL 6
  default installation which are not covered in other sections. Some of
  these services listen on the network and should be treated with
  particular discretion. Other services are local system utilities that
  may or may not be extraneous. In general, system services should be
  disabled if not required.
