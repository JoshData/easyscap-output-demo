title: Disable Quota Netlink (quota_nld)
description: |
  The `quota_nld` service provides notifications to users of disk space
  quota violations. It listens to the kernel via a netlink socket for disk
  quota violations and notifies the appropriate user of the violation
  using D-Bus or by sending a message to the terminal that the user has
  last accessed. The `quota_nld` service can be disabled with the
  following command:

      # chkconfig quota_nld off
rationale: |
  If disk quotas are enforced on the local system, then the `quota_nld`
  service likely provides useful functionality and should remain enabled.
  However, if disk quotas are not used or user notification of disk quota
  violation is not desired then there is no need to run this service.
