title: Disable Quota Netlink (quota_nld)
description: |
  `quota_nld` service provides notifications to users of disk space quota
  violations. It listens to the kernel via a netlink socket for disk quota
  violations and notifies the appropriate user of the violation using
  D-Bus or by sending a message to the terminal that the user has last
  accessed. The `quota_nld` service can be disabled with the following
  command:

      # chkconfig quota_nld off
rationale: |
  `quota_nld` service likely provides useful functionality and should
  remain enabled. However, if disk quotas are not used or user
  notification of disk quota violation is not desired then there is no
  need to run this service.
