title: Disable Cyrus SASL Authentication Daemon (saslauthd)
description: |
  The `saslauthd` service handles plaintext authentication requests on
  behalf of the SASL library. The service isolates all code requiring
  superuser privileges for SASL authentication into a single process, and
  can also be used to provide proxy authentication services to clients
  that do not understand SASL based authentication. The `saslauthd`
  service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig saslauthd off
rationale: |
  The `saslauthd` service provides essential functionality for performing
  authentication in some directory environments, such as those which use
  Kerberos and LDAP. For others, however, in which only local files may be
  consulted, it is not necessary and should be disabled.
