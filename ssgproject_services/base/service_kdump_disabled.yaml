title: Disable KDump Kernel Crash Analyzer (kdump)
description: |
  The `kdump` service provides a kernel crash dump analyzer. It uses the
  `kexec` system call to boot a secondary kernel (“capture” kernel)
  following a system crash, which can load information from the crashed
  kernel for analysis. The `kdump` service can be disabled with the
  following command:

      # chkconfig kdump off
rationale: |
  Unless the system is used for kernel development or testing, there is
  little need to run the kdump service.
