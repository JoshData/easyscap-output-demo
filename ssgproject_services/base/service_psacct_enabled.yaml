title: Enable Process Accounting (psacct)
description: |
  `psacct`, works with programs including `acct` and `ac` to allow system
  administrators to view user activity, such as commands issued by users
  of the system. The `psacct` service can be enabled with the following
  command:

      # chkconfig --level 2345 psacct on
rationale: |
  `psacct` service can provide administrators a convenient view into some
  user activities. However, it should be noted that the auditing system
  and its audit records provide more authoritative and comprehensive
  records.
