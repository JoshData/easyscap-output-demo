title: Enable Process Accounting (psacct)
description: |
  The process accounting service, `psacct`, works with programs including
  `acct` and `ac` to allow system administrators to view user activity,
  such as commands issued by users of the system. The `psacct` service can
  be enabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig --level 2345 psacct on
rationale: |
  The `psacct` service can provide administrators a convenient view into
  some user activities. However, it should be noted that the auditing
  system and its audit records provide more authoritative and
  comprehensive records.
