title: Disable System Statistics Reset Service (sysstat)
description: |
  The `sysstat` service resets various I/O and CPU performance statistics
  to zero in order to begin counting from a fresh state at boot time. The
  `sysstat` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig sysstat off
rationale: |
  By default the `sysstat` service merely runs a program at boot to reset
  the statistics, which can be retrieved using programs such as `sar` and
  `sadc`. These may provide useful insight into system operation, but
  unless used this service can be disabled.
