title: Disable System Statistics Reset Service (sysstat)
description: |
  `sysstat` service resets various I/O and CPU performance statistics to
  zero in order to begin counting from a fresh state at boot time. The
  `sysstat` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig sysstat off
rationale: |
  `sysstat` service merely runs a program at boot to reset the statistics,
  which can be retrieved using programs such as `sar` and `sadc`. These
  may provide useful insight into system operation, but unless used this
  service can be disabled.
