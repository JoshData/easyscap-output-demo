title: Disable Software RAID Monitor (mdmonitor)
description: |
  The `mdmonitor` service is used for monitoring a software RAID array;
  hardware RAID setups do not use this service. The `mdmonitor` service
  can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig mdmonitor off
rationale: |
  If software RAID monitoring is not required, there is no need to run
  this service.
