  crash is detected. Using a variety of plugins, abrtd can email crash
  reports to system administrators, log crash reports to files, or forward
  crash reports to a centralized issue tracking system such as RHTSupport.
  The `abrtd` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig abrtd off
