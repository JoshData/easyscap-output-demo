title: Disable Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (abrtd)
description: |
  The Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (`abrtd`) daemon collects and reports
  crash data when an application crash is detected. Using a variety of
  plugins, abrtd can email crash reports to system administrators, log
  crash reports to files, or forward crash reports to a centralized issue
  tracking system such as RHTSupport. The `abrtd` service can be disabled
  with the following command:

      # chkconfig abrtd off
rationale: |
  Mishandling crash data could expose sensitive information about
  vulnerabilities in software executing on the local machine, as well as
  sensitive information from within a processâ€™s address space or
  registers.
