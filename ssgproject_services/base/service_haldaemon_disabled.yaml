title: Disable Hardware Abstraction Layer Service (haldaemon)
description: |
  The Hardware Abstraction Layer Daemon (`haldaemon`) collects and
  maintains information about the systemâ€™s hardware configuration. This
  service is required on a workstation running a desktop environment, and
  may be necessary on any system which deals with removable media or
  devices. The `haldaemon` service can be disabled with the following
  command:

      # chkconfig haldaemon off
rationale: |
  The haldaemon provides essential functionality on systems that use
  removable media or devices, but can be disabled for systems that do not
  require these.
