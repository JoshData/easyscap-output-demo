title: Enable IRQ Balance (irqbalance)
description: |
  The `irqbalance` service optimizes the balance between power savings and
  performance through distribution of hardware interrupts across multiple
  processors. The `irqbalance` service can be enabled with the following
  command:

      # chkconfig --level 2345 irqbalance on
rationale: |
  In an environment with multiple processors (now common), the irqbalance
  service provides potential speedups for handling interrupt requests.
