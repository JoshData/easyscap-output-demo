title: Disable Apache Qpid (qpidd)
description: |
  The `qpidd` service provides high speed, secure, guaranteed delivery
  services. It is an implementation of the Advanced Message Queuing
  Protocol. By default the qpidd service will bind to port 5672 and listen
  for connection attempts. The `qpidd` service can be disabled with the
  following command:

      # chkconfig qpidd off
rationale: |
  The qpidd service is automatically installed when the “base” package
  selection is selected during installation. The qpidd service listens for
  network connections, which increases the attack surface of the system.
  If the system is not intended to receive AMQP traffic, then the `qpidd`
  service is not needed and should be disabled or removed.
