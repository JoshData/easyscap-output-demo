title: Disable Odd Job Daemon (oddjobd)
description: |
  The `oddjobd` service exists to provide an interface and access control
  mechanism through which specified privileged tasks can run tasks for
  unprivileged client applications. Communication with `oddjobd` through
  the system message bus. The `oddjobd` service can be disabled with the
  following command:

      # chkconfig oddjobd off
rationale: |
  The `oddjobd` service may provide necessary functionality in some
  environments, and can be disabled if it is not needed. Execution of
  tasks by privileged programs, on behalf of unprivileged ones, has
  traditionally been a source of privilege escalation security issues.
