title: Disable vsftpd Service
description: |
  The `vsftpd` service can be disabled with the following command:

      # chkconfig vsftpd off
rationale: |
  Running FTP server software provides a network-based avenue of attack,
  and should be disabled if not needed. Furthermore, the FTP protocol is
  unencrypted and creates a risk of compromising sensitive information.
