title: Disable FTP Uploads if Possible
description: |
  Is there a mission-critical reason for users to upload files via FTP? If
  not, edit the vsftpd configuration file to add or correct the following
  configuration options:

      write_enable=NO

  If FTP uploads are necessary, follow the guidance in the remainder of
  this section to secure these transactions as much as possible.
rationale: |
  Anonymous FTP can be a convenient way to make files available for
  universal download. However, it is less common to have a need to allow
  unauthenticated users to place files on the FTP server. If this must be
  done, it is necessary to ensure that files cannot be uploaded and
  downloaded from the same directory.
