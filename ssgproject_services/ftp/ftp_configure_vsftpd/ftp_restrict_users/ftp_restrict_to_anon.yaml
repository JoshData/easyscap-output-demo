title: Restrict Access to Anonymous Users if Possible
description: |
  Is there a mission-critical reason for users to transfer files to/from
  their own accounts using FTP, rather than using a secure protocol like
  SCP/SFTP? If not, edit the vsftpd configuration file. Add or correct the
  following configuration option:

      local_enable=NO

  If non-anonymous FTP logins are necessary, follow the guidance in the
  remainder of this section to secure these logins as much as possible.
rationale: |
  The use of non-anonymous FTP logins is strongly discouraged. Since SSH
  clients and servers are widely available, and since SSH provides support
  for a transfer mode which resembles FTP in user interface, there is no
  good reason to allow password-based FTP access.
