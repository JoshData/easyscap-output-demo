title: Limit Users Allowed FTP Access if Necessary
description: |
  If there is a mission-critical reason for users to access their accounts
  via the insecure FTP protocol, limit the set of users who are allowed
  this access. Edit the vsftpd configuration file. Add or correct the
  following configuration options:

      userlist_enable=YES
      userlist_file=/etc/vsftp.ftpusers
      userlist_deny=NO

  Edit the file `/etc/vsftp.ftpusers`. For each user USERNAME who should
  be allowed to access the system via FTP, add a line containing that
  userâ€™s name:

      USERNAME

  If anonymous access is also required, add the anonymous usernames to
  `/etc/vsftp.ftpusers` as well.

      anonymous
      ftp
