title: Place the FTP Home Directory on its Own Partition
description: |
  By default, the anonymous FTP root is the home directory of the FTP user
  account. The df command can be used to verify that this directory is on
  its own partition.
rationale: |
  If there is a mission-critical reason for anonymous users to upload
  files, precautions must be taken to prevent these users from filling a
  disk used by other services.
