title: Deny BOOTP Queries
description: |
  Unless your network needs to support older BOOTP clients, disable
  support for the bootp protocol by adding or correcting the global
  option:

      deny bootp;
rationale: |
  The bootp option tells dhcpd to respond to BOOTP queries. If support for
  this simpler protocol is not needed, it should be disabled to remove
  attack vectors against the DHCP server.
