title: Do Not Use Dynamic DNS
description: |
  To prevent the DHCP server from receiving DNS information from clients,
  edit `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`, and add or correct the following global
  option:

      ddns-update-style none;
rationale: |
  The Dynamic DNS protocol is used to remotely update the data served by a
  DNS server. DHCP servers can use Dynamic DNS to publish information
  about their clients. This setup carries security risks, and its use is
  not recommended. If Dynamic DNS must be used despite the risks it poses,
  it is critical that Dynamic DNS transactions be protected using TSIG or
  some other cryptographic authentication mechanism. See dhcpd.conf(5) for
  more information about protecting the DHCP server from passing along
  malicious DNS data from its clients.
