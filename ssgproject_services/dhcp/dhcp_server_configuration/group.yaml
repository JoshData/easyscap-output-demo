title: Disable DHCP Server
description: |
  If the system must act as a DHCP server, the configuration information
  it serves should be minimized. Also, support for other protocols and
  DNS-updating schemes should be explicitly disabled unless needed. The
  configuration file for dhcpd is called `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. The file
  begins with a number of global configuration options. The remainder of
  the file is divided into sections, one for each block of addresses
  offered by dhcpd, each of which contains configuration options specific
  to that address block.

- dhcp_server_disable_ddns
- dhcp_server_deny_decline
- dhcp_server_deny_bootp
