title: Deny Decline Messages
description: |
  Edit `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf` and add or correct the following global
  option to prevent the DHCP server from responding the DHCPDECLINE
  messages, if possible:

      deny declines;
rationale: |
  The DHCPDECLINE message can be sent by a DHCP client to indicate that it
  does not consider the lease offered by the server to be valid. By
  issuing many DHCPDECLINE messages, a malicious client can exhaust the
  DHCP serverâ€™s pool of IP addresses, causing the DHCP server to forget
  old address allocations.
