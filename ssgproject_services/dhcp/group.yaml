description: |
  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows systems to request
  and obtain an IP address and other configuration parameters from a
  server.

  This guide recommends configuring networking on clients by manually
  editing the appropriate files under `/etc/sysconfig`. Use of DHCP can
  make client systems vulnerable to compromise by rogue DHCP servers, and
  should be avoided unless necessary. If using DHCP is necessary, however,
  there are best practices that should be followed to minimize security
  risk.
