title: Configure DHCP Client if Necessary
description: |
  If DHCP must be used, then certain configuration changes can minimize
  the amount of information it receives and applies from the network, and
  thus the amount of incorrect information a rogue DHCP server could
  successfully distribute. For more information on configuring dhclient,
  see the `dhclient(8)` and `dhclient.conf(5)` man pages.
