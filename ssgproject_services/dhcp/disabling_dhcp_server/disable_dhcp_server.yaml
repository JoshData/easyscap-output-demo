title: Disable DHCP Service
description: |
  The `dhcpd` service should be disabled on any system that does not need
  to act as a DHCP server. The `dhcpd` service can be disabled with the
  following command:

      # chkconfig dhcpd off
rationale: |
  Unmanaged or unintentionally activated DHCP servers may provide faulty
  information to clients, interfering with the operation of a legitimate
  site DHCP server if there is one.
