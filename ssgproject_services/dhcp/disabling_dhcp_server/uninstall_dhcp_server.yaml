title: Uninstall DHCP Server Package
description: |
  If the system does not need to act as a DHCP server, the dhcp package
  can be uninstalled. The `dhcp` package can be removed with the following
  command:

      # yum erase dhcp
rationale: |
  Removing the DHCP server ensures that it cannot be easily or
  accidentally reactivated and disrupt network operation.
