title: Check Avahi Responses' TTL Field
description: |
  To make Avahi ignore packets unless the TTL field is 255, edit
  `/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf` and ensure the following line appears in
  the `[server]` section:

      check-response-ttl=yes
rationale: |
  This helps to ensure that only mDNS responses from the local network are
  processed, because the TTL field in a packet is decremented from its
  initial value of 255 whenever it is routed from one network to another.
  Although a properly-configured router or firewall should not allow mDNS
  packets into the local network at all, this option provides another
  check to ensure they are not permitted.
