title: Restrict Information Published by Avahi
description: |
  If it is necessary to publish some information to the network, it should
  not be joined by any extraneous information, or by information supplied
  by a non-trusted source on the system. Prevent user applications from
  using Avahi to publish services by adding or correcting the following
  line in the `[publish]` section:

      disable-user-service-publishing=yes

  Implement as many of the following lines as possible, to restrict the
  information published by Avahi.

      publish-addresses=no
      publish-hinfo=no
      publish-workstation=no
      publish-domain=no

  Inspect the files in the directory `/etc/avahi/services/`. Unless there
  is an operational need to publish information about each of these
  services, delete the corresponding file.
rationale: |
  These options prevent publishing attempts from succeeding, and can be
  applied even if publishing is disabled entirely via disable-publishing.
  Alternatively, these can be used to restrict the types of published
  information in the event that some information must be published.
