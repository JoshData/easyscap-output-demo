title: Disable Avahi Publishing
description: |
  To prevent other mDNS stacks from running, edit
  `/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf` and ensure the following line appears in
  the `[server]` section:

      disallow-other-stacks=yes
rationale: |
  This helps ensure that only Avahi is responsible for mDNS traffic coming
  from that port on the system.
