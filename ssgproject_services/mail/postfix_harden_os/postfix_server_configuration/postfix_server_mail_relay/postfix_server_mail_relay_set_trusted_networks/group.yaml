title: Configure Trusted Networks and Hosts
description: |
  Edit `/etc/postfix/main.cf`, and configure the contents of the
  `mynetworks` variable in one of the following ways:

  -   If any machine in the subnet containing the MTA may be trusted to
      relay messages, add or correct the following line:

          mynetworks_style = subnet

      This is also the default setting, and is in effect if all
      `my_networks_style` directives are commented.

  -   If only the MTA host itself is trusted to relay messages, add or
      correct the following line:

          mynetworks_style = host

  -   If the set of machines which can relay is more complicated, manually
      specify an entry for each netblock or IP address which is trusted to
      relay by setting the `mynetworks` variable directly:

          mynetworks = 10.0.0.0/16, 192.168.1.0/24, 127.0.0.1
