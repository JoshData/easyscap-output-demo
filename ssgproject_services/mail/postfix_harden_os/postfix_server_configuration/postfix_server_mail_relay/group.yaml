title: Control Mail Relaying
description: |
  Postfixâ€™s mail relay controls are implemented with the help of the smtpd
  recipient restrictions option, which controls the restrictions placed on
  the SMTP dialogue once the sender and recipient envelope addresses are
  known. The guidance in the following sections should be applied to all
  machines. If there are machines which must be allowed to relay mail, but
  which cannot be trusted to relay unconditionally, configure SMTP AUTH
  with SSL support.
