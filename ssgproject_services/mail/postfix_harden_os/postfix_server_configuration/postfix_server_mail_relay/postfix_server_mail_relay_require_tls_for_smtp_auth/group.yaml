title: Use TLS for SMTP AUTH
description: |
  Postfix provides options to use TLS for certificate-based authentication
  and encrypted sessions. An encrypted session protects the information
  that is transmitted with SMTP mail or with SASL authentication. To
  configure Postfix to protect all SMTP AUTH transactions using TLS, see
  http://www.postfix.org/TLS\_README.html.
