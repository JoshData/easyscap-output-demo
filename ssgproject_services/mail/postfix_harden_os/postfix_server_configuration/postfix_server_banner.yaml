title: Configure SMTP Greeting Banner
description: |
  Edit `/etc/postfix/main.cf`, and add or correct the following line,
  substituting some other wording for the banner information if you
  prefer:

      smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP
rationale: |
  The default greeting banner discloses that the listening mail process is
  Postfix. When remote mail senders connect to the MTA on port 25, they
  are greeted by an initial banner as part of the SMTP dialogue. This
  banner is necessary, but it frequently gives away too much information,
  including the MTA software which is in use, and sometimes also its
  version number. Remote mail senders do not need this information in
  order to send mail, so the banner should be changed to reveal only the
  hostname (which is already known and may be useful) and the word ESMTP,
  to indicate that the modern SMTP protocol variant is supported.
