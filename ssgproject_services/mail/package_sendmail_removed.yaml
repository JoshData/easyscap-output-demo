title: Uninstall Sendmail Package
description: |
  Sendmail is not the default mail transfer agent and is not installed by
  default. The `sendmail` package can be removed with the following
  command:

      # yum erase sendmail
rationale: |
  The sendmail software was not developed with security in mind and its
  design prevents it from being effectively contained by SELinux. Postfix
  should be used instead.
