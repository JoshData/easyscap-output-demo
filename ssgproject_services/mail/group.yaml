title: Mail Server Software

  \
   Very few systems at any site should be configured to directly receive
  email over the network. Users should instead use mail client programs to
  retrieve email from a central server that supports protocols such as
  IMAP or POP3. However, it is normal for most systems to be independently
  capable of sending email, for instance so that cron jobs can report
  output to an administrator. Most MTAs, including Postfix, support a
  submission-only mode in which mail can be sent from the local system to
  a central site MTA (or directly delivered to a local account), but the
  system still cannot receive mail directly over a network. \
  \
   The `alternatives` program in RHEL permits selection of other mail
  server software (such as Sendmail), but Postfix is the default and is
  preferred. Postfix was coded with security in mind and can also be more
  effectively contained by SELinux as its modular design has resulted in
  separate processes performing specific actions. More information is
  available on its website, http://www.postfix.org.
